## Course content
This course will consist of lectures (HC) covering various modelling approaches to study life at
different levels accompanied by computer practicals (WC) where students will get hands-on experience
on running computational models of the development or the evolution of animals, plants, and microbial
systems.

## General schedule: 

Monday – Guest lectures (mandatory)

Tuesdays / Thursdays– Lecture and practicals (mandatory)

### Key dates: 

  - December 18, 2025: Exam
  - Jan 6, 2026: Miniprojects presentations
  - Jan 29, 2026: Minisymposium

## Learning Goals
The course aims to provide you with an introductory understanding of computational modeling to 
study living systems, and their large range of applications.

After this course the student can:

  - Explain how biological systems can be studied with computational models,
  - Translate a biological system into a working computational model using python,
  - Use algorithmic thinking to break down problems into programmable steps,
  - Identify the underlying assumptions and limitations of computational models,
  - Identify the modeling approach & formalism best suited for a research question.

  **Brightspace**: is the channel for all official communications (*e.g.* final grades). 


  Modeling Life 2025 in Microsoft **Teams**. You can sign up as follows:
  
  - Open MS Teams
  
  - In the menu on the left, select the “Teams” icon
  
  - Click the “Join or create a team” button at the bottom left of the screen (or, depending 
  on the Teams version, at the top right)
  
  - Find the tile that says “Join a team with a code”
  
  - Enter the following code in this field: 6jhv6z5
  
  - Select “Join team”
  
  - Teams is not used to livestream lectures. However, if you have any questions for the
  instructors, student assistants, or your fellow students, it's very helpful to share them on 
  Teams (General channel) so everyone can benefit.

## Grading 

To pass this course, a minimum of 5,5 is mandatory. Your grade is calculated by the 
following components:

Exam:                     70%

Mini project:           30%


You will find your Final grade on Brigthspace.


## Attendance

Attendance is mandatory to all lectures and practicals. Should you be unable to attend, 
please communicate this by email to: [m.l.garciagomez@uu.nl](mailto:m.l.garciagomez@uu.nl).
