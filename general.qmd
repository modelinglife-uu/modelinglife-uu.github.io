## Course content
This course will consist of lectures (HC) covering various modelling approaches to study life at
different levels accompanied by computer practicals (WC) where students will get hands-on experience
on running computational models of the development or the evolution of animals, plants, and microbial
systems.

## General schedule: 

Monday – Guest lectures (mandatory)

Tuesdays / Thursdays– Lecture and practicals (mandatory)

### Key dates: 

  - December 18, 2025: Exam
  - Jan 6, 2026: Miniprojects presentations
  - Jan 29, 2026: Minisymposium

## Learning Goals
The course aims to provide you with an introductory understanding of computational modeling to 
study living systems, and their large range of applications.

After this course the student can:

  - Explain how biological systems can be studied with computational models,
  - Translate a biological system into a working computational model using python,
  - Use algorithmic thinking to break down problems into programmable steps,
  - Identify the underlying assumptions and limitations of computational models,
  - Identify the modeling approach & formalism best suited for a research question.
