**Answer Q1**
  
  An important difference relative to the lecture is that instead of
implementing a production term at the x=0 position, we instead fixed the
concentration of u at x=0 at 100 and have nowhere a production term.
This implies that we assume that production is very high and different D
and d values have negligible effects on the level at x=0. The advantage
of this approach is that we can easily study what different D and d
does, as it only affects the shape of the gradient but not the maximum.

Instead of using if/else to check for boundary conditions, we only
compute the Laplacian in the inner, non-boundary points. For the x=0
boundary we already set a constant value. For y=0 and y=n−1 we copy the
values from y=1 and y=n−2 as the patterning is identical in that
direction. For x=n−1 we use a special approach: if n−3=0 we assume it is
zero; otherwise, we calculate the ratio of x at n−2 and n−3 to
approximate the decay and multiply this with the value at x=n−2 to
estimate x at n−1. Simply copying x at n−2 would add matter to the
system and prevent the gradient from reaching a steady state.

**Answer Q2**
  
  The imposed morphogen profile is an exponential gradient. The negative
sign indicates a decline, the term i·dx converts the grid index to
spatial distance, and the division by √(D/d) ensures that if i·dx = λ =
  √(D/d), we have e⁻¹ = 1/e, meaning an e-fold decay — as expected for a
steady-state diffusion gradient.

**Answer Q3**
  
  The relevant concept is the diffusion length, √(D/d). It is the ratio
between these parameters that determines the characteristic length scale
λ over which the morphogen concentration decays e-fold. Changing both D
and d while keeping the ratio constant preserves the shape of the
steady-state gradient, but faster rates lead to a quicker approach to
steady state.

**Answer Q4**
  
  dA/dt = normal hill(M) − decay term

dB/dt = normal hill(M) × inverse hill(M) − decay term

dC/dt = inverse hill(M) − decay term

Furthermore, kA = kB₁ \< kB₂ \< kC to ensure the switches happen at the
correct positions.

**Answer Q5**
  
  Gene C needs to be induced by low M and repressed by high M. Together
with kA = kB₁ \< kB₂ \< kC, this generates the expected “French flag”
pattern with distinct domains for A, B, and C.

**Answer Q6**
  
  As M decays, A and B will no longer be activated and C will no longer be
repressed, leading to a takeover by C. Consequently, the French flag
pattern disappears.

**Answer Q7**
  
  When the morphogen gradient gradually disappears, C always takes over.
This confirms the prediction that as M declines, C dominates due to loss
of repression on its expression domain.

**Answer Q8**
  
  As M decays, A and B lose activation and C loses repression, again
leading to takeover by C. They will find that mutual repression with
only one neighboring gene is insufficient — stability requires each gene
to repress both others (A repressed by B and C, B by A and C, and C by A
                        and B). This maintains A at the beginning, B in the middle, and C at the
end, although expression domains become sharper.

**Answer Q9**
  
  Achieving a smooth transition between the stable and decaying phases of
M requires integrated gene regulation.

- For genes (or parts thereof) that are positively dependent on M, use
an OR gate (sum): this keeps them on once M disappears, provided
mutual repressors are absent.

- For genes (or parts thereof) that are negatively dependent on M, use
an AND gate (product): this prevents them from expanding when M
vanishes, requiring both low M and absence of repression.

Such combined formulations better represent biological promoter
logic and yield stability before and after the morphogen decline.

**Answer Q10**
  
  Noise has the strongest effect during the initial phase when morphogen
levels dominate, since mutual repression has not yet stabilized the
pattern. As gene expression becomes established and M decays, the system
becomes more robust.

Diffusion of A, B, and C in the lateral direction would further smooth
out local variations and enhance robustness (not implemented in the
                                             current version).

**Answer Q11 (Extra)**
  
  If the domain expands, the C domain enlarges; if the domain contracts,
the C domain disappears. In biological terms, this would mean losing or
gaining posterior body regions (“butt” part).

**Answer Q12 (Extra)**
  
  Introducing a diffusible “expander” molecule E that is repressed by M
but reduces M’s degradation can create scaling of gene domains with
overall tissue size. For example:
  
  ∂E/∂t = p·Kʰ/(Kʰ + Mʰ) − dE + D_E·ΔE

Varying the domain length while plotting results against relative
position (x/L) should show improved scaling of A/B/C domains.

**Answer Q13 (Extra)**
  
  Copying n−2 to n−1 introduces artificial accumulation at the boundary
and prevents steady state. Setting it to zero (sink) has not been tested
but is expected to lower concentrations and possibly speed up
stabilization.

**Answer Q14 (Extra)**
  
  Without assuming quasi–steady-state for M, one can simulate a dynamic
morphogen gradient by allowing production at x=0 to decay over time or
by letting the exponential decline parameter itself vary. This will
likely lead to different transient shapes and small shifts in A/B/C
domains compared to a static exponential.

**Answer Q15 (Extra)**
  
  Implementing diffusion of A, B, and C is expected to smooth out local
noise effects and enhance robustness of the spatial pattern, consistent
with what is observed in natural systems.
