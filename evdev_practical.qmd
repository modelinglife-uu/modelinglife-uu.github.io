## Modeling Thermomorphogenesis in Plants

Plants respond to temperature not only through metabolic changes but also by adjusting 
their morphology. A well known response of plants to increased ambiant temperature is the 
lifiting of their leaves (hyponasty) and increasing their petiole (stalk between leaf and 
stem) length to lower the internal leaf temperature. It is thought that this may help plants 
cope with heat, but it's not always clear whether and if so how this actually improves growth.
In this practical, we will use and extend a small ODE model of carbon (C) and leaf area (LA) 
dynamics and explore how temperature and thermomorphogenic responses affect growth. You'll 
simulate different temperature conditions and analyze how traits like leaf angle and size 
affect photosynthesis and carbon respiration rate, and how this affects overall plant growth. 
Later, you will investigate the adaptive value of this response, as this is still an open question.

## The model
In `code 00_Environment_and_development.py` we start with a simple two ODE model where leaf area ($L$) grows with rate $G$, which depends on carbon concentration ($C_c$) and leaf area. Carbon ($C$) is produced by photosynthesis ($P$) dependent on leaf area, leaf angle ($\alpha$), and temperature ($T$). Carbon is consumed by growth and respiration ($R$), dependent on temperature and leaf area again:

$\frac{dC}{dt}=P(L,T,\alpha)-R(L,T)-G(C_c,L)$

$\frac{dL}{dt}=G(C_c,L)$

### Photosynthesis 

Photosynthesis is a complex process that can be modeled in many different ways with varying
complexity. Here, in the function `Photosynthesis_per_m2()` we included a semi-detailed 
photosynthesis model based on the assumption that the protein RubisCo is the limiting step in
photosynthesis. This model has 6 parameters and 2 environmental variables,  of which all 
parameters are temperature sensitive. This temperature sensitivity is based on the Arrhenius
equation, which describes the temperature dependency of chemical reaction rates.

### Maintenance Respiration
Maintenance respiration is a term used in biological systems to describe all energy/carbon 
consuming processes that a plant must do to survive. Similar to photosynthesis, the rates of 
these reactions increase with temperature, and as such, carbon costs greatly increase. We model 
this in the function Respiration_per_m2() using the Q10 equation, that describes how much a rate
increases for 10 degrees of temperature increase.

##	Algorithmic thinking and Biology - Temperature Effects on Photosynthesis, Respiration and Growth
Let us first investigate how photosynthesis and respiration depend on temperature.

  a. Plot photosynthesis and respiration rate as a function of temperature, using the functions 
  defined above. Explain: What happens to net carbon gain at high temperature? Why is high
  temperature problematic for growth in this model?
  
  b. Run the code and study the output for leaf area and carbon. Why does leaf area increase
  exponentially while carbon levels saturate? What carbon level are you actually plotting?
  
  c. 	Now run simulations of the ODE model for low (15°C), medium (25°C), and high (35°C)     
  temperatures. Which plant performs best? Which plant worst? Why is this?

##	Mathematical & Biological thinking - Hyponasty – Leaf angle increase  

Until now we have investigated the effect of temperature on plants that do not respond to their
environment, but plants do respond to their surroundings.Plants display a variety of responses to
elevated temperature, and one of these is so-called leaf hyponasty in which leaves are positioned 
in a more upward orientation that is often accompanied by longer leaf stems (petioles) and smaller
leaves (blades).  Let us extend the model to first simply include the orientation aspect of this
hyponastic response to high temperature.

  a. 	The photosynthesis function already includes a term for ‘effective leaf area (LA_eff)’, 
  but the function does currently return the total leaf area. Rewrite this function to return
  effective leaf area as a function of leaf elevation angle, assuming that light comes from above.
  Plot the effective leaf area as a function of angle. How does hyponasty affect photosynthesis?
  What other factors could affect effective leaf area?
  b. 	Now investigate the effect of the increased leaf angle on plant growth. Compare medium 
  (25°C) and high temperature (35°C) for normal (20°) and increased (40°) angle.

##	Biology - Hyponasty– Cooling Benefit

Leaf hyponasty is shown to lower leaf temperature with a few degrees by improving heat 
dissipation and decreasing the area in which direct sunlight hits the leaves.

  a. Investigate the effect of the leaf cooling. How much cooling is needed for hyponasty to 
  have a net positive effect? Simply assume a certain cooling effect and hence apply a lower
  temperature than the environmental one.
  
  b. 	Hyponasty is shown to lower leaf temperature by only 1-2°C (see the left picture at the
  beginning of this document), what is the effect of this amount of cooling on plant growth? 
  Would you argue that this hyponastic response is adaptive in the current model (i.e. assuming no
  other factors play a role)?
  
  c. 	Reanalyze the curves describing how photosynthesis rate depends on temperature and how
  effective leaf area depends on angle and explain your earlier results.

##	Biology -Is hyponasty adaptive?
The cooling down of the leaves through hyponasty is thought to be an important adaptive trait.
Interestingly, from the simulations we've done so far this adaptive advantage is not very clear. 
It might therefore very well be that we miss important processes in the current model. In this 
last question of the practical you will extend the model with additional processes also relevant 
in plants to see if this may help explain the adaptiveness of hyponasty. This is also an open
question in current research, so there is no clear answer and you might actually come up with 
novel ideas! To help guide your thinking, we have come up with some additional plant processes 
you can implement and investigate to see how these impact adaptiveness of leaf hyponasty under 
high temperature. Pick one to work on and investigate if this would render hyponasty more clearly
adaptive. If you have extra time, see if you can combinethem. If you have other ideas to work on,
this is also great!

  a. *Hypothesis 1 - Day-Night Rhythm *
  
  We found that during the day, while hyponastic cooling brings photosynthesis closer to its
  optimum temperature and reduces respiration, this is insufficient to overcompensate the costs 
  of reduced effective leaf area. During the night, cooler leaf temperatures still reduce
  maintenance respiration, while photosynthesis halts and hence reduction of effective leaf area
  plays no role, suggesting at night time hyponasty has only advantages. To investigate whether
  this results in a net adaptive effect of leaf hyponasty incorporate the following processes in
  your model:
  - Temperature: Simulate the cooling effect of nighttime.
  - Photosynthesis: Photosynthesis does not occur without sunlight, so simulate the change of 
  light over the day and its effects.
  - Respiration: Maintenance respiration persists in absence of photosynthesis.
  - Hyponasty changes: Leaf angles change over the course of a day, reaching a minimum early during
  the day and being relatively high during the night.
  - Growth rate: Counterintuitively in plants often most growth happens during the night, when
  water loss is minimal and hence turgor pressure is high.
  
  Hint: use sinus functions to describe the daily rhythms and their relative phases. Make sure 
  that light is really zero at night.
  
  a1. Analyze how the absence of photosynthesis at night affects carbon balance. Do you think what 
  you see happening is reasonable? How could you repair this?

  a2. Examine the impact of nighttime temperatures on maintenance respiration rates. 
  
  a3. Explore how changes in leaf angle influence overall plant growth.
  
  a4. Now combine the two
  
  b. 	*Hypothesis 2 – Stomata*
  
  Stomata play a critical role in regulating gas exchange and water loss in plants. As leaf
  temperature increases, stomata open to enhance transpiration, which cools the leaf through
  evaporative cooling. This mechanism is particularly effective in well-watered plants, where
  increased stomatal opening can significantly reduce leaf temperature up to around a maximum of
  9-10°C. However, at very high temperatures, stomata may close to prevent excessive water loss,
  which can lead to overheating. Additionally, stomatal opening increases while stomatal closing
  decreases photosynthesis rates by affecting gas exchange efficiency. Thus, incorporating this
  dependence of stomatal aperture on temperature may enhance the detrimental effects of high
  temperature, offering more opportunity for leaf cooling effects of hyponasty to matter.
  
  To model this, implement the following changes:
  - Stomatal opening affects photosynthesis: Include in the photosynthesis function a
  multiplication factor for stomatal aperture.
  - Stomatal opening depends on temperatures: Include a function that describes how stomatal
  aperture first increases with temperature, reaches a maximum at around 25 degrees and then
  declines for higher temperatures. Aperture should be approximately half the maximum value for
  temperatures of 10 degrees and 35 degrees.
  - Stomatal opening increases transpiration: Simulate the cooling effect of transpiration on leaf
  temperature. 
  
  Analyze how stomatal opening affects leaf cooling and photosynthesis under moderate temperature
  conditions. 
  Investigate the trade-offs between cooling benefits and photosynthesis efficiency at very high
  temperatures. 
  Examine how stomatal closure impacts plant growth and carbon balance under heat stress.
