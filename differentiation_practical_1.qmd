# Gene regulation in time 

## Introduction

In this practical you will get hands on experience into making gene regulatory networks 
models. First you will practice how to encode regulatory interactions into ordinary 
differential equations and logical rules. Next you will study how many interactions produce
self-sustained activity configurations (attractors) in a Boolean network model. Lastly, you 
will learn how to predict the genes that cause cell fate transitions (attractor changes). 

Today we will use the following python file: `circuitsfunctions.py`.  In it you will find 
the code of the functions we use throughout the practical, have a quick look at it. 

## Regulatory interactions

Open Boolean_practical.py and familiarize yourself with the functions `ODEgeneRegulation()` 
and `logicalRule()`. Look at the name of the functions, inputs and outputs. 

Both functions model an `AND` gate where `A` and `B` positively regulate `C`. This 
could represent that A and B are transcription factors that form a protein complex, and 
that it is via this complex that they can regulate the expression of C. 

While `ODEgeneRegulation()` encodes this regulation with an ordinary differential equation that 
requires several parameters, `logicalRule()` only needs the logical operator relating the input genes. 

**ODE implementation**

$\frac{dC}{dt}=p\frac{A^n}{K^n+A^n}\frac{B^n}{K^n+B^n}-dC$

Where $p$ is the production rate, $K$ is the half saturation constant (represents the affinity of a TF 
to the promoter), $n$ is the cooperativity of transcription factor binding, and is the same for $A$ and 
$B$, $d$ is the decay rate. 

**Logical rule implementation**

$C_{t+1}=A_t$ & $B_t$


**Python code for ODE and logical rule**
```python
def ODEgeneRegulation(a,t,parameters): 
    prod=parameters['prod']
    decay=parameters['decay']
    Ksat=parameters['Ksat']
    variableA=parameters['variableA']
    variableB=parameters['variableB']
    n=parameters['n']
    outputC=a[0]
    doutputC=prod*variableA**n/(Ksat**n+variableA**n)*variableB**n/(Ksat**n+variableB**n)-decay*outputC #Tip: Change this in exercise 8.3
    return(doutputC)

def logicalRule(variableA,variableB):
    return(variableA and variableB)
```

## Mathematical thinking

What is the minimum information you need to encode a regulatory interaction with either function? In what cases would you prefer to use an ODE or a logical rule for a model?

:::

Let's run the model to simulate what happens if `A` and `B` are both active/expressed. Do this using the
`ODEgeneRegulation()` and `logicalRule()` functions. Create a new python file, import 
`circuitfunctions.py` and copy the following lines of code inside the main().

```python
# ODErun has three arguments: model, geneA, geneB
A=10
B=10
ODErun(ODEgeneRegulation,A,B) 

# Boolean model
# look at the text in the terminal for the result:
A=1
B=1
print("the boolean operation of variableA ",A," AND variableB",B," is:", logicalRule(A,B))
```

Both implementations of this regulatory interaction produce the same effect, i.e. `C` is active when both
`A` and `B` are active. Yet, the ODE version recovers quantitative differences in `C` activity with values
higher than 1.

Now, let’s explore the output of each function using different values of `A` and `B` We are going to 
use the code below to plot the output of the ODE and the Boolean model in a 2D heatmap. Notice that the exploration values for the ODE model is 11 values (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10), while for a Boolean model is 2 (0 or 1). 

ODE model simulation - AND gate:
```python
explorationvalue = 11 # an ODE model allows us to explore more values than a Boolean model
ode_output = np.zeros((explorationvalue, explorationvalue))
for variableA in range(0, explorationvalue):
    for variableB in range(0, explorationvalue):
        parameters = {'prod': 0.01, 'decay': 0.001,'Ksat': 4, 'n': 2,'variableA':variableA,'variableB':variableB} # prod, decay, Ksat, n, and initial values for A and B
        cells = odeint(ODEgeneRegulation, 0, np.arange(0, 1000.1 , 0.1), args=(parameters,)) 
        ode_output[variableA, variableB] = cells[-1, 0]
```

Boolean network simulation - AND gate:
```python
explorationvalue=2 # a Boolean model assumes there is only 2 possible states: 0 or 1
bool_output = np.zeros((explorationvalue, explorationvalue))
for variableA in range(0, explorationvalue):
    for variableB in range(0, explorationvalue):
        bool_output[variableA, variableB] = variableA and variableB #AND #Tip: Change this in exercise 8.3
```

After running each, this function plots the ODE and Boolean results side by side:
```python
ODEBooleanPlot(ode_output, bool_output)
```

## Biology

 What similarties and differences in the activity of $C$ do you see using each approach? Why is the 
 activity of $C$ higher in the ODE output than the Boolean one?

## Altorithmic thinking:

Now let's compare how ODE and Boolean models represent different regulatory interactions. You can use the same code in the previous box. Remember to modify the logical operator in the Boolean section, and to modify the $doutputC$ equation in the `ODEgeneRegulation` function: 


1. Either `A` or `B` can activate `C`. 
2. `A` represses `C`.
3. `A` and `B` together repress `C`. 
4. `A` represses `C` and `B` activates it.
5. `A` or `B` can activate `C`, but not when both are active at the same time. 
6. any other biological scenario yon can think of! 

* See if you can modify the code to include an extra input variable, and make a 3-variable logical gate.

## Gene regulatory network

Now let's move to a network model made of many individual regulatory interactions (@garcia2020system). 
This model includes regulatory interactions discovered for the cells of plant roots in years
of experimental research. Here, all this knowledge is encoded as logical rules. 

The model consists of 18 variables representing transcription factors, hormones, peptides. Look at the
`rootNetwork()` function in the `circuitFunctions.py` file. This function defines the state of 18 variables
(CK, ARR1, SHY2, AUXIAAR, etc.) based on an input stored in `parameters`, then it updates the state of each 
variable using the logical operators $AND$, $OR$ and $NOT$; the result is stored in `w_variable`. The function returns the update state `w_variable` for each of the 18 variables.  

### Initial condition timecourse
Let us define a random initial condition for each of these 18 variables , and the total number of timesteps 
we will solve the network using the logical functions. First, we need to input the initial condition of the 
variables to `rootNetwork()` using `parameters`. Next, we save the output of this function as the new current 
state. We repeat this procedure iteratively for as many timesteps as we defined, saving in a matrix the 
timecourse of the simulation. This can be done using a for loop as shown below: 

```python
timesteps=20
variables=18
matrix = np.zeros((timesteps+1, variables), dtype=int) 
matrix[0,:] = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=variables) #Random initial condition
for i in range(timesteps):
    parameters= {'CK': matrix[i,0], 'ARR1': matrix[i,1], 'SHY2': matrix[i,2], 'AUXIAAR': matrix[i,3], 'ARFR': matrix[i,4], 'ARF10': matrix[i,5], 'ARF5': matrix[i,6], 'XAL1': matrix[i,7], 'PLT': matrix[i,8], 'AUX': matrix[i,9], 'SCR': matrix[i,10], 'SHR': matrix[i,11], 'MIR165': matrix[i,12], 'PHB': matrix[i,13], 'JKD': matrix[i,14], 'MGP': matrix[i,15], 'WOX5': matrix[i,16], 'CLE40': matrix[i,17]}
    
    matrix[i+1, :] = rootNetwork(parameters) # we save the output in time i+1

plotBooleanTimecourse(matrix,timesteps)
```

At the end the function `plotBooleanTimecourse()` will make a plot to see how each variable in the network 
changes ts activity throughout the simulated timesteps. 100 timesteps is enough to reach an attractor for 
this network. 

* For the initial condition you can also use that of one of the attractors reported in the paper and check 
what happens when you update them.


:::{#exr-non}

## Algorithmic thinking
Try this initial condition: 

```python
matrix[0,:]=[0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0]
```

Solve this initial condition using `rootNetwork()` and `rootNetworkAsynchronous()`. Compare the output in 
each case. What happens and why? What does an asynchronous update do?
:::

:::{.content-visible when-meta="params.show_answers"}

  > **Answer** The asynchronous updating function introduces a probability of update (95%) to each variable in

  > the same time. 

:::

This network has 18 variables, and then $2^{18}$ = 262,144 possible states. We can either solve each of 
these conditions, or instead explore just a subset of them. Using the previous code, add for loop to solve 
100 random initial conditions, and then save the final activity configurations (attractors) in the attractors
matrix. The attractors matrix should have the shape (initial_conditions, variables) so that you can plot the results using the `plotBooleanAttractors()` function. 

* Notice here you should save the final state for each initial condition you explore. 

* tip: 100 initial conditions is a good number to explore. 


```python
ICs=100
attractors = np.zeros((ICs, len(parameters))) 

# your code

plotBooleanAttractors(attractors) # it takes as argument a matrix of attractors
```

:::

You probably found many different attractors. First, let's use a multidimensional reduction technique to 
see how these attractors relate to each other.

```python
UMAPBoolean(attractors)
```

:::{#exr-non}

## Biology / Conceptual thinking
Why do you see clearly defined groups and not a continuous distribution of attractors? 
:::

:::{.content-visible when-meta="params.show_answers"}

  > **Answer** We see clearly defined groups because we are doing the UMAP with the cells that have 
  > already reached an attractor, and not while they are in their trajectory towards the attractor. ![Timecourse simulation: state of the variables (columns) through simulated time (rows).](images/UMAP-10kcells.png){#vegmini1}

:::

Now let's analyse the attractors you found. First, let's group similar attractors using the 
`sorted()`` function:

```python
attractors_sorted = np.array(sorted(attractors.tolist()))
plotBooleanAttractors(attractors_sorted) 
```

:::{#exr-non}

## Biology / Conceptual thinking
Do some attractors occur more frequently than others. Why is this?

:::

## Biology
Some variables are active (1) in the majority of the attractors, others in half, and others in very few. 
In how many attractors is the variable SHR active? What does this suggest about its regulation?
:::

:::{.content-visible when-meta="params.show_answers"}

  > **Answer** How often a variable is active in the attractors, is defined by their logical rules. For

  > another with SHR inactive
  
:::

Now let's remove the repeated rows (duplicate attractor states) to see unique attractors using the 
`np.unique()` function: 

```python
_, unique_indices = np.unique(attractors, axis=0, return_index=True)
attractors_unique = attractors[np.sort(unique_indices)]
plotBooleanAttractors(attractors_unique) 
```

:::{#exr-non}

## Biology / conceptual thinking
How many unique attractors did you find? Compare them with the ones reported in the paper. Are they all fixed points? 
:::

## Cell differentiation – jumping from one attractor to another

Depending on the specific question that we want to answer, it may be better to us a continuous or a discrete
approach to model gene regulation. The lack of parametrization in Boolean models make them suitable to study 
the role of many genes in cell differentiation, particularly if we lack details of the parameters underlying 
each reaction. Yet, the discreteness assumptions may limit how we can use the model to study how morphogens 
that vary quantitatively in space cause cells to change from one state to another. Thus, to study how the 
networks jump from one state to another, a continuous model might be more appropriate.

We can convert a Boolean model into a continuous one. Here you will learn how, and will use the continuous 
model to predict which regulators are able of causing a change in the state of the system (changes in cell 
fate!)

Compare the code of the functions `rootNetwork()` and` rootNetworkODE()`. Notice how in `rootNetworkODE()` 
the logical rules are represented with `min` and `max` functions, that are then used in a sigmoidal function
to model continuous activity in an ODE model. 

| Operator | ODE      |
|:---------|---------:|
| AND.     |   max    |
| OR       |   min    |
| NOT      |   1-n    |

* AND operator is a min function, OR operator is a max function, and NOT operator is 1-x. Use the code below to run a random initial condition for the 18 variables (IC) and see how the system behaves.

```python
timerunning=10.1 
times = np.arange(0, timerunning, 0.1)

IC = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=18).tolist() #random initial condition
parameters = {'decayrate': 1, 'h': 50} 
cells = odeint(rootNetworkODE, IC, times, args=(parameters,)) 

plotODEroot(cells,times)
```

:::{#exr-non}

## Modeling choices
Do the attractors match those recovered with the Boolean network?
:::

:::{.content-visible when-meta="params.show_answers"}

  > **Answer** Yes. The ODE model is built with the same regulatory interactions from the Boolean model. 
  > The difference is that this model allows us to describe quantitative differences in the activity of 
  > the variables  

:::

Now let’s use the model to study cell differentiation. Let’s start in the following initial condition (IC vector),
and find a change in a variable that produce a jump to another attractor (end). For this you can simply flip the
activity of a gene in the initial condition (from 0 ->1 or 1->0) and see the final attractor matches the desired 
end state. 

```python
# We start here: 
IC=[0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0]
# We want to end here. 
end=[1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1]
# variable order
# CK, ARR1, SHY2, AUXIAAR, ARFR, ARF10, ARF5, XAL1, PLT, AUX, SCR, SHR, MIR165, PHB, JKD, MGP, WOX5, CLE40

# your code 

plotODErootTransition(cells,times) # use this function to plot your result
```

## Biology
What regulator causes the transition between these attractors? How many variables change their activity between the initial and final state? what could be the biological meaning of this switch? how would you test this experimentally?
:::

## Biology
Finally, use the model to predict the rest of the attractor transitions because of single variable changes. Are all attractor transitions possible, or are there preferred differentiation routes?
