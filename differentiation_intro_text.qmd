Cell differentiation is the process in which cells acquire specialized functions, giving 
rise to a large array of cell types. This can happen in single cell organisms (bacterial 
cells being in exponential growth, or stationary phase), and multicellular organisms with different cell types organized in tissues and organs (think of blood cells, melanocytes, muscle cells, neurons, etc., in our bodies). This cell specialization results from regulated gene expression: genes are turned on and off in precise combinations, yielding distinct expression profiles. Therefore, cells with an identical genome can be phenotypically different because they express different sets of genes. Yet, how exactly is this differential gene expression regulated? 

Transcription factors are DNA-binding proteins that regulate gene transcription by binding promoters and recruiting other proteins (i.e., polymerase). Numerous transcription factors together with signaling pathways and epigenetic modifications, form gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that govern when and where genes are expressed. In *E. coli*, plants and animals it is estimated that 5-10% of the genes are transcription factors, and then this relative small portion of the genome controls the expression of the rest of the genes. Then, to understand the mechanisms underlying cell identity and behaviour it is useful to focus on how transcription factor activity is regulated. Computational approaches help us decipher the topology and dynamics of gene regulatory networks, and study how they process information to produce the gene expression patterns observed in *normal* and *abnormal* development, how they process information from the neighboring cells or from the environment, 

, and how perturbations in the networks—genetic mutations or environmental challenges—can lead to cell differentiation into other cell types, or even into aberrant cell fates that increase the risk of disease.  and how expression changes in response to intrinsic cues and environmental signals

In this course chapter, you will learn how to use computational models to simulate regulatory interactions within GRNs and to understand how their dynamics generate the gene expression patterns that establish and maintain different cell types.how these cell types are organized in time and space in a tissue/organ/organism. 

For instance, during animal or plant embryogenesis, a single cell—the zygote—divides and undergoes successive lineage decisions to produce the complex array of cell types that comprise an organism.
