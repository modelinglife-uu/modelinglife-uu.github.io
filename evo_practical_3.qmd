# Public goods

## Building a model from scratch

Over the last weeks you have been given many model of biology, and you have modified or extended upon them. For this practical, I will give you a only a description. Your challenge will be to see how far you get in trying to get this model working yourself. I advice you use AI-assisted programming only to solve small steps, otherwise you have no clue what you are doing. But if you try and do everything yourself, it may take a little long. 

At the end of the pratical, we will compare different implementations by students, as well as my implementation. Hopefully, we will see some generic patterns, because the model description should be good enough to give "similar models". The description should be "vague enough" to lead to some differences, but "precise enough" to yield similar results. This is an experiment in and of itself. So let's see :')

Note that I also do not yet know exactly what will happen in this simulation (although I have tried it out), so I'm hoping we will learn some cool stuff together! 

## Simulating a simple microbial ecosystem with "public goods"

### Model description

Microbes often produce public goods, from which surrounding microbes can benefit. This can lead to interesting dynamics, such as cooperation and competition. Most models however consider on 1 public good at a time, which leads to limited diversity (a producer, and a non-producer may or may not coexist). Here, we will an ecosystem with many public goods, and simulate them on a grid. 

An individual microbe will carry a "genome" that is represented by a binary string (101010010011). Each position in the string represents a public good, and whether the individual can produce it (1) or not (0). The individual can rely on other individuals to produce public goods. 

We will simulate individuals (microbial cells) reproducing and dying on a grid. A grid point either contains an individual, or it is empty. Every empty point, will be competed for by individuals that are in that neighbourhood. The neighbourhood is defined as the 8 surrounding grid points (this is called the "Moore" neighbourhood). The cells can only replicate if they have all the public goods they need, which means that they can rely on other individuals in their neighbourhood to produce them. If they do not have all public goods available, they cannot replicate. The "winner" from these (max) 8 viable competitors will be determined by a roulette wheel selection, where the relative probability is determined by their fitness:

$$
F_i = 1 - c \cdot \sum({bitstring})
$$
 
In other words, fitness goes down as the number of public goods produced increases, and there is a cost $c$ associated with producing each public good. Make sure this roulette wheel contains a probability that nobody wins, such that highly unfit individuals are less likely to replicate than highly fit individuals (also see earlier practicals). 

The individual that replicates, can undergo mutations in the bitstring (gene loss and gene gain). Assume gene loss is more likely than gene gain (initial parameters to explore are summarised below)

Finally, implement a function that allows you to mix the grid (all individuals are placed in a random position). 

### Model output

The model will have the following output: a grid that is coloured by the number of public goods produced (for consistency, let's all use a 'viridis' scale), and a line graph that plots the total population sizes, as well as the population sizes of species producing 0 public goods, 1 public good, 2 public goods, etc. (see @fig-examplegrid)

### Parameters to start out with

- Grid size: 50 x 50
- Initial population: produces all public goods (1111...1)
- Death rate: 0.1
- Cost (c): 0.05
- Bitstring 1 to 0 mutation (losing a gene): 0.01
- Bitstring 0 to 1 mutation (gaining a gene): 0.001
- Number of public goods (i.e. bitstring length): 10 
- "No-event" size of roulette wheel: 1

### Proposed experiments

Try investigating how the model behaves with different values of $c$ (the cost of producing public goods). Can you explain what happens at $c=0.0$? 

Try studying the effect of mixing the whole grid every timestep, such that neighbourhoods are constantly "randomised". Look at the population size, as well as the distribution of different types. Can you explain the observations in biological terms?

Try studying what happens at different mutation rates.

> This practical is quite open-ended, so instead of answers it is more useful to have a scientific discussion. The image below was first run on a spatially structured grid, but from the dashed line onwards the grid was mixed every timestep. From this we can see that it matters "who you compete with". On the spatial grid, individuals compete mostly with other individuals of their own species. That means that, on average, they cannot complement each other by providing public goods (they produce the same set!). Because of this, the "omni-producers" (yellow line) dominates, surrounded by a cloud of mutants that rely on other types. The population size fluctuates strongly, as local populations can collapse due to the loss of public goods, typically followed by the "omni-producers" once again invading the available niche space (empty space on the grid). <br><br>
> When mixing the grid every time step, who you interact with is randomised, and individuals can now rely on other genotypes in the population. Although there is some luck involved in this, you can see that the total population (the black line) increases from this point onward. Thus, although the omni-producers are less dominant, statistically individuals are much better off in this mixed world. That said, there is a risk to this mixed population: if the cost of producing public goods is too high, the population can collapse as there is a strong incentive to lose production of public goods and start relying on others. Depending on your implementation, you may find that mixed systems therefor perform better **or** worse than spatially structured systems. If they behave identically though, let me (Bram) know, as that is something I almost never observe in models like this ;)
