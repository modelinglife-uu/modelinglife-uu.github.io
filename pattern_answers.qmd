**Answer Q4**
  
  dA/dt = normal hill(M) − decay term

dB/dt = normal hill(M) × inverse hill(M) − decay term

dC/dt = inverse hill(M) − decay term

Furthermore, kA = kB₁ \< kB₂ \< kC to ensure the switches happen at the
correct positions.

**Answer Q5**
  
  Gene C needs to be induced by low M and repressed by high M. Together
with kA = kB₁ \< kB₂ \< kC, this generates the expected “French flag”
pattern with distinct domains for A, B, and C.

**Answer Q6**
  
  As M decays, A and B will no longer be activated and C will no longer be
repressed, leading to a takeover by C. Consequently, the French flag
pattern disappears.

**Answer Q7**
  
  When the morphogen gradient gradually disappears, C always takes over.
This confirms the prediction that as M declines, C dominates due to loss
of repression on its expression domain.

**Answer Q8**
  
  As M decays, A and B lose activation and C loses repression, again
leading to takeover by C. They will find that mutual repression with
only one neighboring gene is insufficient — stability requires each gene
to repress both others (A repressed by B and C, B by A and C, and C by A
                        and B). This maintains A at the beginning, B in the middle, and C at the
end, although expression domains become sharper.

**Answer Q9**
  
  Achieving a smooth transition between the stable and decaying phases of
M requires integrated gene regulation.

- For genes (or parts thereof) that are positively dependent on M, use
an OR gate (sum): this keeps them on once M disappears, provided
mutual repressors are absent.

- For genes (or parts thereof) that are negatively dependent on M, use
an AND gate (product): this prevents them from expanding when M
vanishes, requiring both low M and absence of repression.

Such combined formulations better represent biological promoter
logic and yield stability before and after the morphogen decline.

**Answer Q10**
  
  Noise has the strongest effect during the initial phase when morphogen
levels dominate, since mutual repression has not yet stabilized the
pattern. As gene expression becomes established and M decays, the system
becomes more robust.

Diffusion of A, B, and C in the lateral direction would further smooth
out local variations and enhance robustness (not implemented in the
                                             current version).

**Answer Q11 (Extra)**
  
  If the domain expands, the C domain enlarges; if the domain contracts,
the C domain disappears. In biological terms, this would mean losing or
gaining posterior body regions (“butt” part).

**Answer Q12 (Extra)**
  
  Introducing a diffusible “expander” molecule E that is repressed by M
but reduces M’s degradation can create scaling of gene domains with
overall tissue size. For example:
  
  ∂E/∂t = p·Kʰ/(Kʰ + Mʰ) − dE + D_E·ΔE

Varying the domain length while plotting results against relative
position (x/L) should show improved scaling of A/B/C domains.

**Answer Q13 (Extra)**
  
  Copying n−2 to n−1 introduces artificial accumulation at the boundary
and prevents steady state. Setting it to zero (sink) has not been tested
but is expected to lower concentrations and possibly speed up
stabilization.

**Answer Q14 (Extra)**
  
  Without assuming quasi–steady-state for M, one can simulate a dynamic
morphogen gradient by allowing production at x=0 to decay over time or
by letting the exponential decline parameter itself vary. This will
likely lead to different transient shapes and small shifts in A/B/C
domains compared to a static exponential.

**Answer Q15 (Extra)**
  
  Implementing diffusion of A, B, and C is expected to smooth out local
noise effects and enhance robustness of the spatial pattern, consistent
with what is observed in natural systems.
