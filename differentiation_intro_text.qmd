Cell differentiation is the process in which cells acquire specialized functions, 
giving rise to a large array of different cell types. This happens in single 
cell organisms (bacterial cells being in exponential growth or stationary phase), 
and multicellular organisms (with different cell types organized in tissues and organs). This 
cell specialization results from regulated gene expression: genes are turned on and off 
in precise combinations, yielding distinct expression profiles. Therefore, cells with 
an identical genome can be phenotypically different if they express different sets of 
genes. Yet, how exactly is this differential gene expression regulated? 

Transcription factors are DNA-binding proteins that regulate gene transcription by binding 
to gene promoters to regulate expression, therefore acting as master switches of gene 
expression. In *E. coli*, plants and animals it is estimated that 5-10% of the genes 
are transcription factors, and then this relative small portion of the genome controls 
the expression of the rest of the genes. Numerous transcription factors together with 
signaling pathways (... and epigenetic modifications) form gene regulatory networks 
that govern when and where genes are expressed. Computational models are useful to study 
how transcription factor activity is regulated, and describe the mechanisms underlying cell 
identity and behavior. For example, they can help us decipher how gene regulatory networks 
produce the gene expression patterns observed in *normal* and *abnormal* development (where 
cells do not differentiate normally), or identify information processing motifs in the 
network that help cells make decisions in response to intrinsic cues and environmental signals.

In this part of the course, you will learn how to use computational models to simulate gene 
regulatory networks and to understand how their dynamics generate gene expression patterns 
that establish and maintain different cell types.
