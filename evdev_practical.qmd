# Modeling Thermomorphogenesis in Plants

Plants respond to temperature not only through metabolic changes but also by adjusting their morphology. A well known response of plants to increased ambiant temperature is the lifiting of their leaves (hyponasty) and  increasing their petiole (stalk between leaf and stem) length to lower the internal leaf temperature. It is thought that this may help plants cope with heat, but it's not always clear whether and if so how this actually improves growth.
In this practical, we will use and extend a small ODE model of carbon (C) and leaf area (LA) dynamics and explore how temperature and thermomorphogenic responses affect growth. 
You'll simulate different temperature conditions and analyze how traits like leaf angle and size affect photosynthesis and carbon respiration rate,  and how this affects overall plant growth. Later, you will investigate the adaptive value of this response, as this is still an open question.

## The model
We start with a simple two ODE model where leaf area (L) grows with rate G, which depends on carbon concentration ($C_c$) and leaf area. Carbon (C) is produced by photosynthesis (P) dependent on leaf area, leaf angle ($\alpha$), and temperature (T). Carbon is consumed by growth and respiration (R), dependent on temperature and leaf area again:

 $\frac{dC}{dt} = P(L,T,\alpha) - R(L, T) - G(C_c, L)$ 
 
 $\frac{dL}{dt} = G(C_c, L)$


### Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is a complex process that can be modeled in many different ways with varying complexity. Here we included a semi-detailed photosynthesis model based on the assumption that the protein RubisCo is the limiting step in photosynthesis. This model has 6 parameters and 2 environmental variables, of which all parameters are temperature sensitive. This temperature sensitivity is based on the Arrhenius equation, which describes the temperature dependency of chemical reaction rates.

### Maintenance Respiration
Maintenance respiration is a term used in biological systems to describe all energy/carbon consuming processes that a plant must do to survive. Similar to photosynthesis, the rates of these reactions increase with temperature, and as such, carbon costs greatly increase. We model this using the Q10 equation, that describes how much a rate increases for 10 degrees of temperature increase.

## Question 1 - Temperature Effects on Photosynthesis, Respiration and Growth
Lets first investigate how photosynthesis and respiration depend on temperature.

Q1.1 Plot photosynthesis and respiration rate as a function of temperature, using the functions defined above. Explain: 
    • What happens to net carbon gain at high temperature?
    • Why high temperature is problematic for growth in this model?

Q1.2 Run simulations of the ODE model for low (15°C), medium (25°C), and high (35°C) temperatures. Which plant performs best? Which plant worst? Why is this?

## Question 2 - Thermomorphogenesis – Leaf angle increase 
Until now we have investigated the effect of temperature on plants that do not respond to their environment, but plants do respond to their surroundings. Let us now extent the model to include this hyponastic response to high temperature.

Q2.1 The photosynthesis function already includes a term for ‘effective leaf area (LA_eff)’, but the function does currently return the total leaf area. Rewrite this function to return projected area onto the ground depending on the angle of the leaf. Plot the effective leaf area as a function of angle. How does hyponasty affect photosynthesis? What other factors could affect effective leaf area?

Q2.2 Now investigate the effect of the increased leaf angle. Compare medium (25°C) and high temperature (35°C) for normal (20°) and increased (40°) angle. What is the effect of leaf hyponasty on plant growth?

## Question 3 - Thermomorphogenesis – Cooling Benefit
The thermomorphogenesis response does also have a positive effect. Leaf hyponasty is shown to lower leaf temperature with a few degrees by improving heat dissipation and decreasing the area in which direct sunlight hits the leaves.

Q3.1 Investigate the effect of the leaf cooling. How much cooling is needed for hyponasty to have an effect? 

Q3.2 Hyponasty is shown to lower leaf temperature 1-3°C, what is the effect of this cooling on plant growth? And would you argue that the response is ‘justified’ by the current model, i.e. is the cooling benefit large enough to justify the costs of hyponasty?

## Question 4 - Is Thermomorphogenesis Adaptive?
The cooling down of the leaves is often thought to be an important adaptive trait. From the simulations we've done so far this is not very clear.
It might therefore very well be that we miss important processes in the current model besides the photosynthesis efficiency and maintenance respiration rate. 
In this last question of the practical you will extent the model with a thermomorphogenic process that you think can play a role in increasing plant growth.
This is also an open question in current research, so there is not one correct answer. To help you think, we have come up with some hypothesis you can implement and investigate.
Pick one hypothesis to work on and investigate if this would provide an adaptive benefit? If you have extra time, see if you can combine multiple hypotheses.


### Hypothesis 1 - Day-Night Rhythm
During the night, cooler temperatures reduce maintenance respiration rates, but photosynthesis halts as sunlight is no longer available. To model this, implement the following changes for nighttime conditions:

- **Temperature drops**: Simulate the cooling effect of nighttime.
- **No photosynthesis**: Photosynthesis does not occur without sunlight.
- **Respiration continues**: Maintenance respiration persists despite the absence of photosynthesis.
- **Hyponasty decreases**: Leaf angles return to a less pronounced state.

- Analyze how the absence of photosynthesis at night affects carbon balance.
- Examine the impact of reduced nighttime temperatures on maintenance respiration rates.
- Explore how changes in leaf angle during the night influence overall plant growth.

Additionally, plants store carbon during the day to compensate for the lack of photosynthesis at night. Investigate whether this carbon storage provides advantages at specific times of the day or over extended periods. 
Analyze how these day-night dynamics influence overall plant growth and adaptation.

### Hypothesis 2 - Stomata
Stomata play a critical role in regulating gas exchange and water loss in plants. As leaf temperature increases, 
stomata open to enhance transpiration, which cools the leaf through evaporative cooling. 
This mechanism is particularly effective in well-watered plants, where increased stomatal opening can significantly reduce leaf 
temperature up to around 35°C. However, at very high temperatures, 
stomata may close to prevent excessive water loss, which can lead to overheating. 
Additionally, stomatal opening increases photosynthesis rates by improving gas exchange efficiency.

To model this, implement the following changes:

- **Stomatal opening increases transpiration**: Simulate the cooling effect of transpiration on leaf temperature.
- **Stomatal opening enhances photosynthesis**: Include the effect of improved gas exchange on photosynthesis rates.
- **Stomatal closure at high temperatures**: Model the reduction in cooling and photosynthesis efficiency due to stomatal closure.

- Analyze how stomatal opening affects leaf cooling and photosynthesis under moderate temperature conditions.
- Investigate the trade-offs between cooling benefits and photosynthesis efficiency at very high temperatures.
- Examine how stomatal closure impacts plant growth and carbon balance under heat stress.

### Hypothesis 3 - Leaf Aspect Ratio
Leaf size and shape can influence both photosynthesis and respiration rates. Smaller or thinner leaves may reduce maintenance respiration costs due to a lower overall biomass, while potentially maintaining a relatively high photosynthesis rate per unit area. A response often seen during thermomorphogenesis is a change in the 'leaf-aspect ratio', where the leaf width decreases but the length stays the same. What is also observed is that leaves become thinner, maintaining their surface area, but decreasing the biomass and thus respiration demand. 

To model this, implement the following changes:

- **Smaller and/or thinner leaves reduce respiration costs**: Simulate the effect of reduced biomass on maintenance respiration rates.
- **Leaf-aspect area changes with temperature**: Model the effect of different leaf shapes on effective leaf-area.

- Analyze how altering leaf thickness and aspect ratio affects plant growth under varying temperature conditions.
- Investigate the trade-offs between reduced respiration costs and decreased leaf area.
- Determine if smaller and/or thinner leaves provide an adaptive advantage under heat stress.
