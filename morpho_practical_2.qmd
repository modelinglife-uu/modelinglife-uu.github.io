## Gene regulatory interactions

In this practical you will get hands on experience on building models of gene regulatory interactions. Today you will:

- make logical functions and ODE to describe gene regulation examples
- use a Boolean network of a *relatively* large network to find the attractors
- use an ODE model based on the boolean model to predict how to jump from one attractor to other (cell fate changes!) 

## Gene regulation Examples

*Add an overview of genetic regulation and its importance in biological systems.*

## Boolean network model

*Summarize key concepts and terminology related to gene regulation.*

## Boolean-network

*Describe mathematical and computational models used to study gene regulation over time.*

## UMAP

*Provide practical examples or case studies.*

## References

*List relevant literature and resources.*
