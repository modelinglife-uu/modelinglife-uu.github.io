    "text": "Modeling life\nThis website accompanies the Modeling Life course at Utrecht University. It primarily serves as a central hub for all the practicals (werkcolleges), with the necessarily files, links and other resources for each day.\nEach practical has its own page containing background explanations, code snippets, and questions that are designed for you to learn about the models. Most of these exercises build directly on the lectures, allowing you to explore biological questions—such as how morphogen gradients form, how spatial patterns emerge, or how cells evolve to “stick together”.\nYou can navigate the site using the sidebar or the left. The General Course Info section outlines the general course info (exams, learning goals, etc.). You can also find the Schedule on this website. The individual practicals sections provides detailed instructions for each day. In the second part of the course you will get even more experience doing things yourself by working on a mini-project.\nWe hope you’ll use this website actively. There’s lots to read, simulate, modify, and explore.\n\nNote: the Modeling Life course is new. This website is to help you, but is by no means perfect. Please let us know if you see any mistakes, typo’s or other issues. Any constructive feedback on how to make things better and easier for you is always welcome.",

    "text": "The field of pattern formation studies the mechanisms that underly the formation of spatial patterns in biological systems. Patterns may arise at any biological level of organization, from single cells polarizing to decide in which direction to move, grow or divide, to the formation of body axes, different cell types and shapes that set apart complex multi-cellular organisms from amorphous blobs, to entire ecosystems patterning where e.g. plants do and do not grow. An important concept in pattern formation is so called “symmetry breaking”, which refers to the destruction of an originally homogeneous or non-patterned state, to a non-homogeneous patterned state (see figure below).\n\n\n\n\n\nFocusing on multi-cellular development, pattern formation addresses how within an organism in which all cells (except for germ cells that have undergone meiosis and immune cells applying VJ recombination) share the same genetic material “symmetry is broken” resulting in usage of a different subset of genes and functions by different cells. Symmetry breaking is needed for the creation of body axes, domains with different functions as well as repeating elements.\nA limited range of mechanisms leading to symmetry breaking exist, which have been used time and again by evolution to create patterns in animals, plants, fungi and multicellular algae. Major mechanisms are morphogen gradients, where graded distribution of a signal provides distinct input to cells parallel to the gradient allowing both regionalization and segmentation; Turing patterns, where initial noise combined with diffusion induced destabilization lead to repetitive patterns, and clock-and-wavefront patterning where autonomous oscillations combined with growth and a memorization mechanism provide an alternative means for segmenting a tissue. We will explore these 3 mechanisms in the practicals. In addition, in plants self-organized patterning of auxin transporters underly phyllotaxis (the positioning of new leaf organs at the shoot apex) and leaf venation. Note that this list of symmetry breaking mechanisms is not exhaustive and additional mechanisms such as lateral inhibition and planar cell polarity exist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks throughout part I-V\n\n\n\nAlthough this course is divided into 5 clearly distinct topics, there is also substantial overlap. We challenge you to see how all sections use similar concepts, and to think about how different types of models may even be combined. To help you along with this integrated view of modelling biology, we will below discuss some of the links with future topics. It may be a good idea to go back to this text later in the course, and reflect if you indeed see all the links.\n\n\nOften, initial signals like gradients and clocks are transient, implying that the patterns they induce require additional mechanisms of memorization. Critical for understanding this memorization process is the concept of multistability, where two or more alternative stable states of the system exist and the initial signals bring the system from the original to a new patterned state. This concept will be further explored in Part III of the course which focuses on Differentiation. Of course, to form a multicellular organism with a functional shape, simply telling a blob of cells where the head or tail needs to be or which cells will become finger bones and which cells will apoptose to carve out the tissue between the fingers is insufficient, and actual shape changing processes need to occur. This we will discuss in Part II.\nParticularly for animal development, simply breaking symmetry and stably memorizing formed patterns is not enough, scaling of the pattern with body plan size and robustness against noise from gene expression, cell division, cell signalling and other processes is essential for fitness. In contrast, in plants developmental plasticity, the potential to adjust developmental patterning to environmental conditions, plays a key role. This latter concept will be discussed in Part IV of the course on Environment.\nThe repeated usage of a limited number of possible symmetry breaking mechanisms also raises interesting evolutionary questions (Part V). Are there indeed only a limited number of options, or did evolution select for specific mechanisms that are more robust or more evolvable? Or are some mechanisms simply easier to find? This way of evolutionary thinking will be further discussed in Part V.",

    "text": "2.1 Morphogen Gradients and Patterning\nIn this practical, we a going to look at how an organism can form segments along its body axis . The mathematical model that we will implement and study is an implementation of the so-called French flag conceptual model first proposed by Lewis Wolpert (Wolpert 1969). It assumes the spatially graded expression of a morphogen “M” that influences the expression of some downstream genes A, B and C. Their expression is often visualized by red, white and blue and the arising pattern resembles the French flag, hence the name (see the power of visualization).\nOne of the most well-studied organisms when it comes to body axis segmentation (although its segmentation mechanism is evolutionary derived and a-typical!) is the development of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Supporting the ideas of Wolpert, it was found that through tethering maternal Bicoid mRNA to one side of the embryo, Bicoid protein can form a gradient extending along the anterior-posterior axis, with so called gap genes as a first tier in the segmentation hierarchy differentially responding to different Bicoid protein levels (Driever and Nüsslein-Volhard 1988). Later it was found that often at least two opposing morphogen gradients drive downstream gene expression and genes typically respond to multiple inputs.",

Some examples:\n\n\\(\\frac{dX}{dt} = a(\\text{tf1}) + b(\\text{tf2})\\): Gene X is induced by transcription factor 1 and 2 in an OR fashion, either \\(a(\\text{tf1})\\) or \\(b(\\text{tf2})\\) needs to be high to give high transcription of X.\n\\(\\frac{dY}{dt} = a(\\text{tf1})\\cdot b(\\text{tf2})\\): Gene Y is induced by transcription factor 1 and 2 in an AND fashion, both \\(a(\\text{tf1})\\) and \\(b(\\text{tf2})\\), which are being multiplied, need to be high to give high transcription of X.\n\nNote that the shape of \\(a(\\text{tf1})\\) and \\(b(\\text{tf2})\\) (increasing or decreasing function of the transcription factor) determines whether tf1 and tf2 are repressing or activating.",

How is this different from the gradient formation modeling we discussed during the lecture? What is done at the terminal boundary in the length direction and why does this make sense? (hint: outcommented we provided code doing essentially the same but not using numpy arrays and hence written in a less compact matter to help you understand what is happening)\n\n\nAnswer An important difference relative to the lecture is that instead of implementing a production term at the x=0 position, we instead fixed the concentration of u at x=0 at 100 and have nowhere a production term. This implies that we assume that production is very high and different D and d values have negligible effects on the level at x=0. The advantage of this approach is that we can easily study what different D and d does, as it only affects the shape of the gradient but not the maximum.   Instead of using if/else to check for boundary conditions, we only compute the Laplacian in the inner, non-boundary points. For the x=0 boundary we already set a constant value. For y=0 and y=n−1 we copy the values from y=1 and y=n−2 as the patterning is identical in that direction. For x=n−1 we use a special approach: if n−3=0 we assume it is zero; otherwise, we calculate the ratio of x at n−2 and n−3 to approximate the decay and multiply this with the value at x=n−2 to estimate x at n−1. Simply copying x at n−2 would add matter to the system and prevent the gradient from reaching a steady state.\n\n\nExercise 2.2 (Important concept) Play with the morphogen diffusion rate and the morphogen decay rate and describe what happens. What happens in terms of dynamics and steady state if you change both, but the ratio stays the same? Hint: it might help to draw a horizontal line at a certain height to ease comparison.\n\n\nDiffusion length concept =√(D/d), it is the ratio of these factors that determines the length scale lambda over which the morphogen concentration decays an e-fold. So with the same ratio, you get the same steady state gradient. However, it will still approach the steady state faster.\n\n\nExercise 2.3 (Biology & mathematical thinking) Next, we are going to introduce the genes A, B and C in the model. We want these genes to be expressed dependent on M, and in the head, trunk and tail respectively, so A on the left, B in the middle and C on the right. Think of what conditions in terms of M should lead to expression of A/B/C. What Hill functions (normal/inverse/any combination) corresponds to those conditions? Write down (pen and paper, not in code) full equations for the genes, do we need any other terms than just Hill functions, would we need specific parameter conditions?\n\n\nAnswer  \\(dA/dt\\) = normal hill (M) – decay term \\(dB/dt\\) = normal hill (M) * inverse hill(M) – decay term, \\(dC/dt\\) = inverse hill (M) -decay term. Furthermore, \\(kA=kB1&lt;kB2&lt;kC\\) to ensure the switches happen at the right places.\n\n\nExercise 2.4 (Biology & algorithmic/mathematical thinking) From hereon we assume that the morphogen gradient reaches steady state very quickly, and no longer use the numerical implementation of the diffusion equation and instead work with a superimposed morphogen profile defined by reaction_diffusion_gradient to save time. (Hint: to not call the function any more use # in front of where it is called) Change the simulation loop such that it computes the morphogen gradient once. What type of function is the superimposed morphogen profile and how does this relate to question 2.\n\n\nAnswer The imposed morphogen profile is an exponential gradient, the – indicates it is a declining function, the \\(i\\cdot dx\\) is to convert position in the spatial grid to actual distance, and the /sqrt(D/d) ensures that if \\(i\\cdot dx=lambda=\\sqrt(D/d)\\) we have \\(e^{-1}=1/e\\) and hence an e-fold decline as is the case for a steady state diffusion gradient.\n\n\nExercise 2.5 (Biology & algorithmic/mathematical thinking)  \n\nNow create functions to update A, B and C according to your equations from the previous question. You may use the predefined hill and ihill functions that are provided in the code. For simplicity, you may keep most of the parameters the same across genes, but some have to be different to ensure the right location of the genes (see your reasoning to the previous question). (Hint: using array properties to update A/B/C, like in the reaction_diffusion_step function, makes your code run a lot faster than using for-loops)\nAlso make sure that the levels of A, B and C are updated in the simulation loop. (Hint: using array properties to update A/B/C, like in the reaction_diffusion_step function, makes your code run a lot faster than using for-loops)\nNext, ensure A, B and C are visualized in the bottom plot axis (copy and adapt the code for the visualization of M). You can add an extra third axis to the plot to visualize the (French) flag pattern, by getting which of the three genes is maximal at each location with np.argmax(np.array([A, B, C]), axis=0)and turning that into an array of RGB colors of choice.\nDo you get the expected “French flag” pattern? If not, think of why not and improve your equations from previous question, parameters or your code.\n\n\n\nAnswer Look at code 02_answer_morphogengradient_superimposed_quickABC.py. You will find that gene C needs to be induced by low and repressed by high M. And as explained above: kA=kB1&lt;kB2&lt;kC.\n\n\nExercise 2.6 (Biology) At some point in development, the morphogen gradient will disappear, for example in the case of the Drosophila Bicoid gradient because the maternal mRNA is degraded. Predict what will happen to the expression of A,B and C (and hence the French flag pattern) if the morphogen gradient disappears over time and assume A, B, and C are regulated by our equations (first try think about this without actually simulating this).\n\n\nAnswer As M decays A and B will no longer be activated and C no longer repressed, hence the takeover by C. The French flag pattern disappears.\n\n\nExercise 2.7 (Algorithmic/mathematical thinking) Now write the code in reaction_diffusion_gradient that updates the morphogen concentration, such that after the time point A, B and C have gotten close to equilibrium, the morphogen gradient gradually disappears. Adapt the simulation loop where necessary and run your code: was your prediction on A/B/C from the previous question correct? Why/why not? Hint: you might need to increase the duration of your simulation, especially if it takes a long time for A, B and C to reach equilibrium (or you can change the parameters to speed things up by using same production/degradation rate ratio yet higher absolute values of the individual parameters).\n\n\nAnswer It should always result in C taking over. See answer to 6.\n\n\nExercise 2.8 (Biological & mathematical thinking) A, B and C cannot remain in a stable pattern if they are only influenced by M. How can we stabilize the pattern in absence of M? Test your ideas by creating new update functions for A, B and C and let these new ‘rules’ kick in at the same time when M starts to decline. Again, you may find Hill functions useful and perhaps also the before/after switch time structure used in reaction_diffusion_gradient for M. (Hint: think about how the genes should affect each other, and assume that in this new phase, when genes have already been initialized in absence of repression the genes will be expressed). Can you maintain the expression domains of A, B and C and does their shape change?\n\n\nAnswer See 03_answer_morphogengradient_superimposed_quickABC_phase2.py As M decays A and B will no longer be activated and C no longer repressed, hence the takeover by C. They will find mutual repression with only your neighbor gene is not enough, you need it with both 2 other genes. So A needs to be repressed by B and C, B by A and C, and C by A and B. We can maintain A at the beginning, B in the middle and C at the end, but the shape of the expression domains becomes less gradual and more sharply defined.\n\n\nExercise 2.9 (Biology & algorithmic/mathematical thinking) A sudden switch from phase 1 (stable M gradient) to phase 2 (decaying M gradient) resulting in the genes following different differential equations is biologically implausible. In reality, genes have complex promotors and enhancers integrating different inputs that arise in different developmental stages. Try to come up with one integrated expression for each gene, incorporating simultaneous input from the morphogen gradient and the other genes. Create new update functions for A/B/C and test your ideas. Can you get a stable pattern before and after the decline in M? A couple of things you could consider: a. Think of how positively and negatively M regulated expression behave once the gradient starts declining: what is the best way to combine (AND/OR) that with the regulation by the genes? a. Consider splitting up the M regulated expression of middle gene B into a positive and negatively regulated morphogen part before integrating the other genes inputs. a. It is also possible to give certain genes a bit of a constant boost to prevent their takeover by other genes due to timing issues\n\n\nAnswer This is not at all easy (or as the professor would say “highly non trivial”). It requires that for genes (or part of their input) being positively dependent on M that there is an OR gate (sum) (so they stay on once M is absent as long as the mutual repressors are absent) while for genes (or part of their input) being negatively dependent on M that there is an AND gate (so they do not expand once M is absent but require both M absent and mutual repressors absent). See the answer code: 05_&lt;longname&gt;_quickABC_phase2_combined.py\n\n\nExercise 2.10 (Biology & algorithmic/mathematical thinking) Write code to get noise in the morphogen gradient, both in its steady state and decaying phase. During which phase do the expression domains of A, B and C suffer more from the noise. Explain why? How could we make the system more robust in a manner that is also likely occurring in nature?\n\n\nAnswer See the answer code: 05_&lt;longname&gt;_quickABC_phase2_combined_noise.py The noise has more effect in the initial phase when mostly morphogen is driving the expression domains, as gene expression becomes established and morphogen levels decay the mutual repression ensures stability against the noise Diffusion of A, B and C, in the lateral direction this evens out differences (not implemented right now)",

    "text": "2.5 Extra questions\nIf you’re done early or a master student, you can make these extra questions. These questions need not be made in the order they are provided, you can choose what you would like to investigate.\n\nExercise 2.11 (Biological thinking) Play with the size of the domain to see what happens to the gene expression domains. What would this mean for an organism?\n\n\nAnswer You may find that if the domain expands the C domain expands and that if the domain shrinks the C domain disappears. This would mean having either a very large or loosing your “butt” part.\n\n\nExercise 2.12 (Biological & algorithmic thinking) Various mechanisms have been proposed to ensure that the domains of the morphogen controlled genes scale with the size of the domain. One proposed mechanism suggests the existence of an also diffusible “expander” molecule which expression is repressed by the morphogen but which itself either represses the degradation of the morphogen or enhances its diffusion (see e.g. https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0912734107 and https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dgd.12337).\nFor the expander we can write:\n\\[\n∂E/∂t=p K^h/(K^h+M^h )-dE+D_E ∆E\n\\]\nAssume E reduces degradation of M (easier to implement than enhancement of diffusion) and study the effect of scaling. (Hint, vary the size of the domain in the length direction but plot domains as a function of relative instead of absolute domain size to compare domain sizes).\n\n\nAnswer We have not tried this out. Let us know what you find!\n\n\nExercise 2.13 (Algorithmic thinking) In b, we can also implement other boundary conditions, especially for the right boundary. What happens to the profile if we make a no-flux boundary by copying the value at n-2 to n-1? And what if we set it to a sink (force concentration to zero)?\n\n\nAnswer Copying n-2 to n-1 adds material, so now concentration at end keeps rising and gradient fails to reach equilibrium. Putting it to sink not tried, may speed up stabilization of gradient\n\n\nExercise 2.14 (Algorithmic thinking) From question 4 onwards, how do things change if we do not assume a quasi-steady-state for the morphogen gradient (i.e. keep the morphogen dynamics instead of replacing it by the superimposed exponential)? How would you implement a disappearing gradient and how does it shape change the outcomes of the flag?\n\n\nAnswer Instead of only initializing position x=0 at 100, you now need to include it in the update of the diffusion and use a decaying exponential behind the value of 100 beyond a certain point. Not tried myself, likely somewhat different shape change than simply decreasing an exponential along the entire axis proportionally, may affect sizes and dynamics of domains.\n\n\nExercise 2.15 (Algorithmic thinking) Implement your solution to make the system more robust for noise from question 10. Did it work?\n\n\nAnswer This requires also having A, B and C diffuse and is expected to smooth out differences.",

    "text": "A foundational work in Theoretical Biology is Alan Turing’s paper “The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis” [1]. In this work, Turing mathematically demonstrates a plausible mechanism whereby a reaction-diffusion system can lead to the formation of a spatially-patterned solution in steady state. Mathematically and conceptually, Turing’s key innovation was considering diffusion-driven instability. That is: An unpatterned steady state solution becomes unstable in the presence of diffusion, leading to the formation of a spatially patterned state.\nTuring-type patterns emerge when a system exhibits short-ranged activation and long-ranged inhibition. The most well-known realization of a Turing reaction-diffusion system is the combination of a slow-diffusing activator and fast-diffusing inhibitor. Many more examples exist which can be reduced to a mathematically equivalent form. In this practical, we will explore a 3-component Turing system developed by Raspopovic and coauthors to explain the patterning of fingers on the paws of mice [2].\nIn this practical you will work with a total of 6 different python codes. Please note that each code simply differs by an extension or modification from the previous code, so that in the end you will have a long script that performs all the steps in one go.",

Simplify the BSW model scheme to a 2-component system and explain why the relevant Turing constraints apply to the BSW model.

In the substrate-depletion model, the growth of the slow-diffusing activator A is constrained by the local loss of fast-diffusing substrate S. Around an A-enriched domain a halo of S will form, which will induce nearby A domains to grow, generating the alternating spatial pattern. In the BSW model, Sox9 indirectly locally self-activates by inhibiting its slow-diffusing inhibitor Wnt, but the growth of Sox9 domains is constrained by depletion of the fast-diffusing Bmp (playing the role of substrate in this model). Around Sox9-enriched domains a halo of Bmp will form and induce the generation of more Sox9 domains in the surroundings.",

    "text": "3.2 Patterning in a fixed domain size\nThe code in the script 01__digits_squarehomogeneoustissue.py simulates the model in a 2D square tissue of constant size. This setup can be considered as a small region of a large Petri dish in which mesenchymal cells have been plated with the correct chemicals to undergo bone formation (Supplementary Figure S3 in the paper).\n\nExercise 3.2 (Biology) Play with the reaction parameters and diffusion constants to study their effects on the wavelength of the patterns. Note down the following:\n\nWhich parameter changes lead to a pattern with thicker/thinner stripes?\nWhich parameter changes lead to a pattern with spots?\n\nNote: To make things easier on yourself, only change one parameter at a time. Use a narrow range around the reference value to stay in the numerically stable regime of the forward Euler solver. If the solution becomes blank or wildly oscillating, you’re likely in the numerically unstable regime and you should try a smaller change of values. When increasing diffusion constants, you may need to reduce the time stepping dt.\n(only Master students) Based on the BSW interaction scheme, give a short interpretation of why the following parameter alterations change the spatial pattern:\n\nParameters of Sox9-BMP interaction k2 and k4\nParameters of Sox9-Wnt interaction k3 and k7\nFold change difference in BMP diffusion compared to Wnt diffusion\n\nHint: Use the maximum and minimum values of the variables to guide your thinking.\n\n\nFor simplicity I will only show Sox9 patterns:\n\n\n\n\nIn general, all three components follow similar trends in terms of concentrations as any impact on one component will affect the others via feedbacks. Increasing or decreasing the parameters k2 and k4 has the same effect on the pattern.  With increased Sox9 activation (high k2) a lower amount of BMP is sufficient to get Sox9 to increase which in turn inhibits both Wnt and Bmp. As a result, the “peaks” are reached sooner in space resulting in shorter lower amplitude wavelengths. Similarly, when Sox9 inhibition of BMP is high (high k4) then BMP peaks are lower, which means there is less Sox9 activation leading to smaller amplitude peaks and hence shorter wavelength. Conversely, if Sox9 activation by BMP is weak (low k2), then it takes more BMP to build up to a peak, resulting in longer higher amplitude wavelengths. When Sox9 inhibition of BMP is weak (low k4), then it takes larger Sox9 domains to deplete BMP, resulting in longer higher amplitude wavelengths. If Sox9 activation (k2) or BMP inhibition (k4) are extremely strong, Sox9 locally depletes BMP faster than it can diffuse, which in turn leads to a reduction in Sox9; this could explain local oscillations and travelling waves, though this result should be verified with a better numerical scheme. Changing BMP self-inhibition (k5) has the opposite effect as Sox9 activation (k2) and BMP inhibition (k4). BMP self-inhibition restricts the size of BMP domains. Stronger self-inhibition (high k5) means small pockets of BMP are destabilized and Sox9 regions grow until the point that they completely deplete the local BMP, resulting in larger higher amplitude peaks. Vice-versa, reducing BMP self-inhibition (low k5) allows BMP peaks to more easily form, leading to shorter pattern wavelengths. Unlike the other two parameters, this reduction only happens up to a point, as the other feedback interactions take over.\n\n\n\nIncreasing or decreasing the parameters k3 and k7 has the same effect on the pattern. When Wnt inhibition of Sox9 is increased (high k3) or Sox9 inhibition of Wnt is increased (high k7) the cross-inhibition of both variables is stronger, meaning they will tend to create larger exclusion zones which translates as longer higher amplitude wavelengths. When Wnt inhibition of Sox9 is decreased (low k3) or Sox9 inhibition of Wnt is decreased (low k7) smaller regions can coexist, reducing the wavelength and the amplitude. Even lower cross-inhibition means the regions overlap, and small time delays could lead to oscillations, although this should be verified with a numerically better scheme. Wnt self-inhibition (k9) limits the growth of Wnt domains. When self-inhibition is strong (high k9) Wnt domains shrink and therefore the wavelength is shorter with lower amplitude. Even stronger self-inhibition leads to overlapping domains and similar oscillations as observed for low k3 and low k7. Vice-versa, a decrease of Wnt self-inhibition (low k9) allows larger patches of Wnt to form, which increases the wavelength and the amplitude.\n\n\n\nThe equation for Sox9 includes a “saturation term” in the form of a negative cubic power of Sox9, which means that effectively there is Sox9 self-inhibition in the model. The parameter delta multiplies a quadratic Sox9-dependent term in the equation for Sox9, which by default is set to 0. A positive delta effectively means that Sox9 has a self-activation term that counteracts the self-inhibition by the cubic saturation term, whereas a negative delta means the Sox9 self-inhibition is stronger. Introducing a stronger Sox9 self-activation (delta &gt; 0) increases the amplitude of Sox9 domains. Due to this local strong increase in Sox9, there is also a local strong depletion of BMP which prevents stripes from elongating, resulting in a spot pattern. Introducing a stronger Sox9 self-inhibition (delta &lt; 0) reduces the amplitude of Sox9 domains. There is thus less BMP depletion which enables stripes to elongate and fuse more easily. Wnt and Sox9 are cross-inhibitory, and thus their domains will compete. Lower Wnt diffusion means Wnt domains form locally, leading to a reduced wavelength. Vice-versa a higher Wnt diffusion means that Wnt spreads away from Sox9 domains enabling them to expand ultimately resulting in longer wavelengths. Note that since BMP diffusion scales with Wnt diffusion, both parameters were changed at the same time. The ratio of diffusion speeds defines the size of the Turing space. As the diffusion of BMP is set equal to that of Wnt, the homogenous solution becomes stable. Reducing the diffusion of BMP further leads to travelling waves or oscillations. This is because a slow (or stationary) BMP is in a local negative feedback loop with Sox9, which results in oscillatory behavior. The establishment of Wnt domains around the oscillating Sox9 regions is also oscillatory. Increasing BMP diffusion allows to more effectively “feed” Sox9 domains, which leads to a subtle increase in the wavelength and amplitude.",

As the growth speed increases, the alignment shifts to stripes perpendicular to the growth direction. When growth is slow, the “new domain” added by growth is too small to fit a Turing wavelength. As a result, the existing pattern gets extended into the new parts. When growth is fast, the “new domain” added by growth is sufficiently large to fit a Turing wavelength, which becomes the selected mode. Additionally for faster growth, the diffusion/growth ratio is now lower making it harder to simple extend the existing pattern from diffusion of the old cells that previously made up the boundary.\n\n\n\n\nSimulations from this practical with domain growth\n\n\n\n\n\nExperimental work using a light-gated chemical reaction that forms Turing patterns when illuminated.

    "text": "3.5 Patterning along two growth axes\nIn reality, the limb bud grows in both the proximo-distal and anterior-posterior direction. In the script 03__digits_growingsquare.py this is implemented with growth rates vi for proximo-distal growth and vj for anterior-posterior growth.\n\nExercise 3.5 (Biology) Play with the relative size of these growth rates and study what happens. Compare the order of appearance of stripes to the experimental data in the paper (see Figure 3F in the Raspopovic paper).\n\n\nAnswer As in the previous question, the rate of growth influences whether stripes grow parallel to or perpendicular to the growth boundary. Also as before, slow horizontal growth promotes horizontal stripes (vi&lt;=0.1), and when this becomes faster stripes reorient to become vertical. However now, if we add vertical growth and it is not small enough relative to the horizontal growth, above and below the horizontal stripes we get vertical stripes and these domains are larger the faster vertical growth is relative to horizontal growth. So to get ok-ish patterns we need horizontal growth not too fast, and vertical growth to be slower. These results are consistent with horizontal growth of the “paddle” being faster than vertical growth. Also, we see that middle horizontal stripes appear earlier than the outer ones (in those situation where not all is vertical), similar to what we see in the paper in Fig 3F. Still interestingly, if you put vj=0.2 and vi=0.1 you promote initially vertical and later on horizontal stripes, this is an effect of in the vertical direction hitting the boundaries of the domain first and then still slowly continuing growth in the horizontal dimension at a not too high rate that was supportive of extending horizontal stripes.\n\n\n\n\nSimulations from this practical with domain growth",

Is the concentration elsewhere in the tissue changed?\nDo you think this approach is reasonable to model biological growth of a tissue? Explain why/why not.\nHint: Think about it from the perspective of a growing cell containing a number of molecules “X”.\nIf the cell increases in volume and does not produce/degrade X, what happens to the concentration of X?\nWhat would be the concentration of X in the two daughter cells if the cell divides?\nHow would the situation change if X is constantly produced and degraded?\nIn the paper, Raspopovic et al. create a “tissue growth map” (see Figure 3A), which they use to map concentration values from one timepoint to the next using interpolation-based transformations.\nInspired by this approach, the script 04__digits_growingsquare.py implements a different growth function that uses bilinear interpolation to expand the tissue. Play around with the growth rate parameters and compare the results to what you found earlier. Do the patterns differ? If yes, how do they differ?\nHint: Try the supplementary script supp_g__bilinear_interpolation.py to understand how interpolation-based growth works.\nFor master students: yet another way of implementing tissue growth would be to take cell division and inheritance of maternal state by the two daughter cells literal and implement this by new boundary cells copying the state of their direct neighbors. Implement this alternative growth and see how this affects your results.\n\n\nAnswer The default value of newly added tissue is 0, because the entire matrix is initialized with 0s, and only a small rectangle corresponding to the initial tissue domain is filled with random values and then updated based on the equations. When growth happens, the tissue domain extends to cover new parts of the matrix that were not included in the initialization. Extending the edges into 0-valued territory would be as if new, empty cells appear at the edges of the tissue, which is not a reasonable approach to model limb bud growth.If a cell increases in volume without producing/degrading molecules “X”, then the concentration of X will decrease as the cell increases in volume. Daughter cells would have on average half the concentration of X as the mother cell. If “X” is constantly produced and degraded (and the cell is a well-mixed environment) then the concentration of X could be in quasi-steady state during growth. A growing cell would maintain the same concentration of X over time. When the cell divides, both daughter cells would inherit the same concentration of X as the mother cell had. Assuming the latter scenario is more likely, then growth of a tissue should work by “stretching” the values of the growing parts. (Some tissues actually do grow only at the edges, but even there we would expect the newly added “territory” to be made from previous cells and therefore still inherit their concentrations.)\n\n\nThe different growth appears to affect pattern formation, e.g for vj=0.01 the pattern is still predominantly horizontal for 0.15, which was less so before. In constrast for vj=0.05 and vi=0.15 pattern is mostly vertical whereas in other growth regime it was still partly horizontal. Seems that transition from horizontal to vertical stripes is thus modulated. So for low vj it is easier to get horizontal stripes.",

In reality, digits are patterned further apart at the distal end than at the proximal end, where they need to converge on a hand and wrist. This implies that the wavelength of the Turing pattern should not be constant. In a previous question you probably found that the k7 and k4 parameters impact the wavelength of the Turing pattern. The authors speculate that the FGF and Hox gene gradients observed in the limb bud exert an effect on the Sox9-BMP-Wnt patterning module through these parameters.\n\nExercise 3.7 (Biology) The script 05__digits_squarek4k7gradient.py allows you to implement exponential gradients of k4 and k7 across the tissue. You can set the minimum and maximum values, axis (x=horizontal, y=vertical) and direction (0=decreasing, 1=increasing). Look in the supplement of the Raspopovic paper, page 48 Fig 2C, left for the estimated change of k4 and k7 across the tissue and try to reproduce (not exactly but similarly) Figure 2C, right side, by playing with the parameters affecting the k4 and k7 gradients.

Hoxd13 is highly expressed in the distal domain of the paddle and not expressed elsewhere, and this expression domain is growing as the paddle grows. FGF is expressed from the distal edge of the paddle and spreads through diffusion. For an illustration see Fig S8A of the supplement of the Raspopovic paper (page 10). Experimental data furthermore suggest that Hoxd13 and FGF together affect k4 and k7, which the authors decided to model using the following equations:\n\\[\nk4^* = k4 - k_{HF_{bmp}} * fgf(i,j) * hox(i,j)\n\\]\n\\[\nk7^* = k7 + k_{HF_{wnt}} * fgf(i,j) * hox(i,j)\n\\]\n\nExercise 3.8 (Algorithmic and biological thinking) The script 06__digits_squarehoxdfgf.py implements how k4 and k7 are a function of local FGF and Hox values, but does not yet include Hox and FGF spatial patterns and how these develop over time.

The output may look sometimes like this:\n\n\nThe Hox domain starts as a narrow vertical band and expands backward. The FGF gradient develops from the rightward boundary. Since a certain amount of Hox and FGF is needed to result in k4 and k7 values permissive of Turing patterns the stripes develop from right to left and because of the wavelength changes induced by different Hox and FGF values become closer together towards the left.

    "text": "3.9 Shape makes the tissue\nHaving studied the effects of growth and genetic factors modulating the Turing pattern now it is time for the final step. So far, we’ve approximated the limb bud very crudely with a rectangle. As you probably noticed in your parameter exploration, the tissue boundary can bias stripe orientation. Therefore it is interesting to study the interplay between the shape of the “paddle” or limb bud in which the digits develop and how it grows with the temporal development of the hox and fgf patterns. In the script 07__digits_growingpaddle.py we implemented two different tissue geometries: An ellipse and a “paddle” that imitates the shape of the limb bud. Note that to implement Hox and FGF domains on a complex growing shape, quite a bit of complex code involving masks describing the tissue domain and angles to control the Hox and FGF domains was needed. At first, we are going to ignore these technical details.\n\nExercise 3.9 (Biology) Switching between geometries is easily done by changing the value of the parameter geometry on line 78 of the script. Start with the “ellipse” geometry. What do you observe with regards to the FGF gradient? What consequences does this have? Why would this be “a smart thing to do”?\nPlay around with vi/vj and Lx0 to investigate the effect of ellipse shape and development over time on the number, shape and robustness of digits that form.\nNow switch to the paddle geometry. Observe the patterns that emerge and compare these to the simulated and experimentally observed patterns in Figure 3E and 3F of the Raspopovic article. According to you what does and what doesn’t the model explain well?\nThe model explains the formation and positioning of the 4 digits, and how the distance between these digits increases along the limb bud. However, the model clearly does not simulate/explain the formation of the wrist bones that is observed experimentally. Interestingly the experimental data suggest that while digits may form from the “right to the left”, the “leftmost” bones of the wrist are there the earliest, suggesting there locally different conditions apply allowing earlier Turing patterning but with a very large wavelength happening there.\nTo implement non-square geometries, the script uses “masks”. Study how these masks are created in the functions create_ellipse_mask and create_tissue_mask.\nHint: Try the supplementary script supp_i__geometries.py.\nNote: For computational convenience, we use the “Class” data structure to implement common functions shared by the masks. This is a somewhat more advanced programming concept, so it’s ok if you don’t understand what it does yet. For the extra curious and motivated, feel free to check out the supplementary script supp_i__class_data_structure.py.\n\n\nAnswer Fgf gradient forms from bottom to top, as a consequence bottom fingers form first, often one of the bottom fingers forms and than splits. While in general Turing mechanisms give patterns they are not reproducible in terms of the positioning of the stripes. By starting the highest point of the FGF gradient locally it is determine where the first digits can arise, generating control over the positioning of the digits. Vi 0.1 goes okay, 0.2 stretched and splitting of digits  Vj too low too little room so less than 5 digits, vi too high more than 5 fingers, higher rates result in less reproducible patterns Below a nice pattern showing 5 fingers, but also showing near splitting of one of the fingers at the end The model explains the formation and positioning of the 4 digits, and how the distance between these digits increases along the limb bud. However, the model clearly does not simulate/explain the formation of the wrist bones that is observed experimentally.

    "section": "4.4 Questions",
    "text": "4.4 Questions\n\nExercise 4.1 (Biology) In practical 1 we saw how gradients can be created through local production, diffusion and decay. However, other mechanisms for gradient formation are possible, such as cell lineage transport. Here we work with a model for the FGF gradient (fgfgradientfromgrowth.py) where only the rightmost/posterior cell produces FGF and grows, and in which cells upon division inherit this FGF from their mother cell. Play with the model by varying the decay rate of FGF and the division rate of the cells. How does this affect the gradient?\n\n\nAnswer If growth rate goes up cell volumes increase faster, causing more dilution of FGF and hence a lower maximum of the gradient as due to the stable protein quite some time is needed to compensate for this decrease by more production, at the same time the gradient is less steep as cell division follow up faster and hence less time has passed and less day has taken place. If decay rate goes up, maximum goes down but gradient become steeper and shorter as for same time between divisions more decay takes place\n\n\nExercise 4.2 (Conceptual thinking) When would this type of gradient formation be more applicable than the earlier studied production, diffusion, decay type of gradient formation? Compare how this model is built-up to a production/diffusion/decay gradient formation model.\n\n\nAnswer Diffusion slow, degradation slow. In other words, a mostly stable, immobile compound.\n\n\nExercise 4.3 (Mathematics) Let us now move to the other half of the clock and wavefront model, the clock part (clock.py), in which we implemented one of the earliest models for the somitogenesis oscillator from Lewis (2003) which models a gene that codes for a mRNA (\\(m\\)) that encodes a protein (\\(p\\)) that acts as a repressive transcription factor of this same gene. In class we discussed how for oscillations negative feedbacks, delays and non-linearity are important. Examine the code to find the differential equations governing this model and determine the negative feedback, delay and non-linearities in them.\n\n\nAnswer Non-linearity is in saturation function with power n, negative feedback is because affects own expression negatively, delay is here modeled explicitly through a special delay type differential equation\n\n\nExercise 4.4 (Biology) Play with the parameters of the model. How does the delay (tau/ \\(\\tau\\)) affect oscillations?\n\n\nAnswer longer period (lower frequency) and higher amplitude. Remember how in class we discussed how removing introns reduced delays and affected oscillator period.\n\n\nExercise 4.5 (Algorithmic thinking) In the file rolling_clock.py, there is a different implementation of the clock. Compare the two files and find out how they differ. What benefits for studying the model does clock.py have over rolling_clock.py and vice versa? Ignore the added functions __copy__ and set_tau in this comparison. Some differences become clearer when you run the code too.\n\n\nAnswer The rolling clock only remembers a certain time window of the clock state, namely as long as needs to be remembered plus some buffer for when the clock’s tau changes. A drawback is that not all history is memorized, but it could still be stored to a file. A big win is clear when we run the code and see that it is much faster, especially at later time points.\n\n\nExercise 4.6 Next, we will combine the clock and FGF wavefront into a single model. For this, we offer two options of this exercise: A. reading and interpreting existing code from the file clockplusfgf.py, or B. write your own code to combine the two.\n\nRead and interpret existing code: Read the code of clockplusfgf.py and try to understand the assumptions from this model implementation by answering the following questions:\n\nEach cell has its own clock. What clock states is the tissue initialized with? And what clock states do newly divided cells get?\nThe FGF wavefront affects tau: what function is used for that? What are your expectations for the effect of the FGF wavefront on the cells’ clocks?\nDoes growth affect the clock state?\nWhat is your opinion on the assumptions from the three questions?\n\n\n\n\nAnswer 1. The cells are initialized with the same state, namely the default with m=0 and p=0, and all clock parameters set to one defined in the file. Newly divided cells get the same clock as the original cell, so we get two exact copies. 2. The function is \\[\\tau_\\text{cell}=\\tau_\\text{model}(1+0.5\\frac{100-\\text{FGF}\\_\\text{cell}}{100}),\\] where \\(\\tau_\\text{cell}\\) is the cell’s new \\(tau\\) and \\(\\tau_\\text{model}\\) the general “model” one’s. So, we would expect tau to become larger, i.e., the clock to become slower as the FGF wavefront decays the further to the left we get. 3. No, there is currently no dilution from \\(m\\) or \\(p\\) from growth. 4. If we start with few cells that are likely also each other’s sister cells, the assumption of the same, or at least similar clock states is plausible. Same for cell division assuming the molecules get evenly distributed. The current function of FGF on \\(\\tau\\) is imposed, but the idea of slowing down is from experimental observations. We could argue about the effect of growth on the clock state, but only few cells are dividing, so including growth in there would have only a limited effect (but feel free to test this!).\n\n\nExercise 4.7 (Programming) As to not spoil the beans to students not wanting to code the model extension, since the hints for programming may answer above questions, please see instructions for implementing it yourself at the end of this tutorial.\n\n\nBiology With the existing model, or your own model working, describe how this model behaves. Do we get stable somites?\n\n&gt; **Answer** *we get waves of oscillations moving from left to right with increasing\n&gt; amplitudes. Not yet conversion to a stable stripe pattern*\n\nBiology & Programming What is still missing is a means to transform the temporal oscillations in the posterior of the tissue into a spatial pattern in the anterior. Now, let’s implement a model that allows for fixation of the somite states.\n\nWe will add an extra ‘memory’ molecule M inside the cell that will be produced depending on the values of FGF and the clock.. To do so add a new attribute to the cell Class that will contain the value of a memory molecule. Also, upon division, let cells inherit the memory value from the mother cell.\nChange the run_clocks function by creating two conditions:\n\nIf the fgf level is between some upper and some lower bound, the clock is updated and simulated after the memory value is updated according to this formula: \\[\\frac{dM}{dt}=c\\max\\left(\\frac{p^4}{h_p^4+p^4}, \\frac{M^4}{h_M^4+M^4}\\right)-\\delta M.\\] Add the new memory parameters as global parameters at the top of the file. For starters, you can give them the following values:\n\n\\(\\text{FGF upper bound}=10\\)\n\\(\\text{FGF lower bound}=9.75\\)\n\\(c=0.01\\)\n\\(h_p=8.5\\)\n\\(h_M=0.5\\)\n\\(\\delta=0.01\\)\n\nOtherwise, the clock is updated and simulated as normal, and nothing changes with the memory molecule of the cell\n\nTo visualize the memory, follow the same procedure as for visualizing the fgf and p values: put in a string referring to the new attribute you created for the molecule in step 1.\n\nBiology Do you get stable somite formation on the left/anterior of the tissue? Is it a regular pattern of somites? What happens if the requirement for updating \\(M\\) is only that FGF should be below a certain value? What happens if the equation for \\(\\frac{dM}{dt}\\) only depends on \\(p\\) and not \\(M\\) itself.\n\n\nAnswer They should get somite patterns that are stable, but not necessarily regular. If only one threshold all goes to high state, because eventually all go through all phases, you need to memorize who was within a limited time/space window in a particular state. If only P dependent M is activated but does not memorize so it will be just as unstable as P before.\n\n\nBiology Both zebrafish and mice are common model organisms, so we know a lot about the biological parameters of their somitogenesis.

    "text": "4.7 Combining the clock and FGF wavefront model - programming instructions\nLet us now combine the (rolling) clock and the wavefront, and assume that the FGF wavefront affects tau such that as FGF levels drop tau goes up and oscillations slow. Here are some tips and hints to help you along the way:\n\nTry implementing things in steps and run your code in between steps: this is easier to debug than changing everything in one go.\nUse the file rolling_clock.py to import the clock class from. Make sure that every cell gets initialized with a clock by adding a clock as a cell Class attribute.\nOf course, we must not forget that a cell inherits the clock from its mother. Use the __copy__ method from the clock Class to set the clock of the freshly divided daughter cell the same as the mother’s.\nThere are many ways that FGF could affect tau. For this tutorial, stick to the following relationship: \\[\\tau_\\text{cell}=\\tau_\\text{model}(1+0.5\\frac{100-\\text{FGF}\\_\\text{cell}}{100}),\\] where \\(\\tau_\\text{cell}\\) is the tau of a specific cell, and \\(\\tau_\\text{model}\\) is a global tau set as a model parameter. To implement this, create a method update_clock for the cell Class, that uses the clock Class’s set_tau method to update the clock of the cell.\nMake a method in the tissue class called run_clocks that simulates the clock of every cell in the tissue. Use the Clock’s simulate method. For simplicity, we assume that growth does not affect the concentrations of \\(m\\) and \\(p\\).\nMake sure that the tissue method run_clocks also updates the clock of the cell, and that the simulate_development function also lets the clocks run.\nVisualize the p values of every cell. You can reuse the existing visualisation methods initialize_axis_cell_data and update_plot_cell_data from graphics.py, but now let them display p values instead of fgf values. You can give the name of the attribute as a string to the initialize_axis_cell_data function, so something like clock.p_values[-1] instead of fgf might already work depending on your exact implementation of the clock.\nOnce you’re done, check if your model behaves as it should with the teacher/assistant or the file clockplusfgf.py directly.",

This could represent that A and B are transcription factors that form a protein complex, and that is via this complex that they can regulate the expression of C. While ODEgeneRegulation() encodes this regulation with an ordinary differential equation that requires several parameters, logicalRule() only needs the logical operator relating the input genes.\ndef ODEgeneRegulation(a,t,parameters): \n    prod=parameters['prod']\n    decay=parameters['decay']\n    Ksat=parameters['Ksat']\n    nodeA=parameters['nodeA']\n    nodeB=parameters['nodeB']\n    n=parameters['n']\n    outputC=a[0]\n    doutputC=prod*nodeA**n/(Ksat**n+nodeA**n)*nodeB**n/(Ksat**n+nodeB**n)-decay*outputC  \n    return(doutputC)\n\ndef logicalRule(nodeA,nodeB):\n    return(nodeA and nodeB)\n\nExercise 8.1 (Mathematical thinking) What is the minimum information you need to encode a regulatory interaction with either function? In what cases would you prefer to use an ODE or a logical rule for a model?\n\nLet’s run the model to simulate what happens if nodeA and nodeB are both active/expressed. Do this for the ODE and the Boolean logic code model using the following lines inside the main().\n# ODE model - see the parameters used in circuitsfunctions.py\n# ODErun has three arguments: model, geneA, geneB\nA=10\nB=10\nODErun(ODEgeneRegulation,A,B) \n\n# Boolean model\n# look at the terminal for the result:\nA=1\nB=1\nprint(\"the boolean operation of nodeA \",A,\" AND nodeB\",B,\" is:\", logicalRule(A,B))\nNow, let’s explore the output of each function using different values of nodeA and nodeB. We are going to use the code below to plot the output of the ODE and the Boolean model in a 2D heatmap.\n# First, Boolean network simulation - AND gate\nexplorationvalue=2 # a Boolean model assumes there is only 2 possible states: 0 or 1\nbool_output = np.zeros((explorationvalue, explorationvalue))\nfor nodeA in range(0, explorationvalue):\n    for nodeB in range(0, explorationvalue):\n        bool_output[nodeA, nodeB] = nodeA and nodeB #AND # CHANGE THIS\n\n# Now, ODE model simulation\nexplorationvalue = 11 # an ODE model allows us to explore more values than a boolean model\node_output = np.zeros((explorationvalue, explorationvalue))\nfor nodeA in range(0, explorationvalue):\n    for nodeB in range(0, explorationvalue):\n        parameters = {'prod': 0.01, 'decay': 0.001,'Ksat': 4, 'n': 2,'nodeA':nodeA,'nodeB':nodeB} # prod, decay, Ksat, n, and initial values for A and B\n        cells = odeint(ODEgeneRegulation, 0, np.arange(0, 1000.1 , 0.1), args=(parameters,)) #np.shape\n        ode_output[nodeA, nodeB] = cells[-1, 0]\n\n# use this code to see your ode and boolean results side by side\nODEBooleanPlot(ode_output, bool_output)\n\nExercise 8.2 (Biology) What differences do you see in each case? (differences in what?!) Discuss x, y, and z (question is a little short otherwise)\n\nNow let’s compare how ODE and Boolean logic represent different logical gates. You can use the same code in the previous box. Remember to modify the logical operator in the Boolean section, and to modify the doutputC equation in ODEgeneRegulation:\n\neither nodeA or nodeB can activate outputC (OR gate)\nthat nodeA represses outputC (NOT gate)\nthat both nodeA and nodeB repress outputC (NOT nodeA & NOT nodeB )\nthat nodeA represses outputC but nodeB activates it (NOT nodeA, yes nodeB)\nthat nodeA or nodeB can activate outputC, but not both at the same time (XOR gate)\nany other biological scenario yon can think of!\n\n\ntip: include an extra input node, and make a 3-node logical gate.\n\n\nExercise 8.3 (Algorithmic thinking) Q3 Is there a logical gate that can be better represented with an ODE than with Boolean logic?

This model includes regulatory interactions experimentally determined in the cells of plant roots, here they encoded as logical rules. The model consists of 18 nodes representing transcription factors, hormones, peptides, and multitude regulatory interactions among them. Look at the rootNetwork() function in the circuitFunctions.py file. See how the activity of each node is determined by the state of its regulators using and combining the logical operators AND, OR and NOT. Find the model here: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60251-8\nLet’s define a random initial condition for each of these 18 nodes, and the timesteps to solve the system using the logical functions. To find the state of the nodes in the network the next timestep, we need to give the state of our nodes to the rootNetwork() function, and then save the output of this function. We will save in matrix the initial condition, and how these 18 nodes change in the timesteps defined. At the end the function plotBooleanTimecourse() will show us the network changes in the simulated timesteps. * tip: 100 timesteps is enough to reach the attractors. For the initial condition you can also use that of one of the attractors reported in the paper and check what happens when you update them.\ntimesteps=20\nnodes=18\nmatrix = np.zeros((timesteps+1, nodes), dtype=int) \nmatrix[0,:] = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=nodes) #Random initial condition\nfor i in range(timesteps):\n    parameters= {'CK': matrix[i,0], 'ARR1': matrix[i,1], 'SHY2': matrix[i,2], 'AUXIAAR': matrix[i,3], 'ARFR': matrix[i,4], 'ARF10': matrix[i,5], 'ARF5': matrix[i,6], 'XAL1': matrix[i,7], 'PLT': matrix[i,8], 'AUX': matrix[i,9], 'SCR': matrix[i,10], 'SHR': matrix[i,11], 'MIR165': matrix[i,12], 'PHB': matrix[i,13], 'JKD': matrix[i,14], 'MGP': matrix[i,15], 'WOX5': matrix[i,16], 'CLE40': matrix[i,17]}\n    matrix[i+1, :] = rootNetwork(parameters)\n\nplotBooleanTimecourse(matrix,timesteps)\nInstead of a random initial condition try this one:\nmatrix[0,:]=[0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0]\nUse the asynchronous updating scheme by changing the function to rootNetworkAsynchronous() and see what happens to this initial condition.\n\nExercise 8.4 (Algorithmic thinking) Q4 What happens now and why? What does an asyncrhonous update do?\n\nThis network has 18 nodes, and then 218 = 262,144 possible states. We can either solve each of these conditions, or instead explore just a subset of them. Using the previous code, add for loop to solve 100 random initial conditions, and then save the final activity configurations (attractors) in the attractors matrix. *tip: 100 initial conditons is a good number to start with. # The attractors matrix should have the shape (initial_conditions, nodes) so that you can plot the results using the function plotBooleanAttractors.\nICs=100\nattractors = np.zeros((ICs, len(parameters))) # new\n\n# your code\n\nplotBooleanAttractors(attractors) # it takes as argument your matrix of attractors\nYou probably found many different attractors. First, let’s use a multidimensional reduction technique to see if each of initial conditions form groups of similar cells.\nUMAPBoolean(attractors)\n\nExercise 8.5 (Biology / abstract thinking) Q5 Why do you see clearly defined groups and not a continuous distribution of attractors?\n\nNow let’s analyse the attractors you found. First, let’s group similar attractors:\nattractors_sorted = np.array(sorted(attractors.tolist()))\nplotBooleanAttractors(attractors_sorted) \n\nExercise 8.6 (Biology / abstract thinking) Q6 Do some attractors occur more frequently than others. Do they all have the same basin size of attraction? Why is this?\n\n\nExercise 8.7 (Biology) Some nodes are active (1) in most attractors, others in half, and others in very few. In how many of them is the node SHR active? What does this suggest about their regulation?\n\nNow let’s remove the repeated rows (duplicate attractor states) to see unique attractors:\n_, unique_indices = np.unique(attractors, axis=0, return_index=True)\nattractors_unique = attractors[np.sort(unique_indices)]\nplotBooleanAttractors(attractors_unique) \n\nExercise 8.8 (Biology / abstract thinking) How many unique attractors did you find?

To study the role of many genes in cell differentiation, a Boolean model might be better particularly if we lack details of the parameters underlying each reaction. If we want to study how cells jump from one state to another, a continuous model might be more appropriate.\nHere we will see how we can convert the Boolean model to a continuous one and use it to predict which regulators are able of causing a change in the state of the system (changes in cell fate!)\nCompare the code of the functions rootNetwork() and rootNetworkODE(). Notice how in rootNetworkODE() the logical rules are represented with min and max functions, and then used in a sigmoidal function to create a continuous ODE model. * AND operator is a min function, OR operator is a max function, and NOT operator is 1-x.

Auxin is a hormone virtually involved in all developmental processes in plants, from embryo patterning and floral organ determination to leaf disposition and root growth. In each context, auxin triggers specific responses, which can be explained by the underlying regulatory networks—namely by the redundancy of molecular players in the auxin signalling pathway (the auxin response factors, ARFs), and how they are expressed in different tissues.\nIn the root, researchers have found an auxin–WOX5 paradox: some experiments show that auxin promotes the expression of WOX5 (a root stem cell transcription factor), while others found WOX5 repression. This opposite auxin regulation is mediated by different ARFs—ARF5 and ARF10—posing the possibility that accounting for both ARF5 and ARF10 regulatory networks can reconcile the results. To this end, you will use an in silico root model to address this paradox and propose an explanation.",

A subset of these cells expresses WOX5, maintaining the surrounding cells as stem cells. WOX5 is regulated by several factors, and network models help us understand how.\nThe Boolean network used last week describes the gene and hormonal activity configurations of the cells in the root apex. In this model WOX5 is regulated positively by ARF5 and negatively by ARF10 and CLE40. Auxin regulates stem cell activity in the roots, and multiple links exist between auxin and the regulators in the Boolean network. Both ARF5 and ARF10 are auxin response factors activated by auxin. Moreover, root transcription factors control ARF5 and ARF10 expression such that they are not expressed in every cell of the root apex. This regulation is included in the Boolean model we studied last week. Whether this is relevant to understanding the auxin–WOX5 paradox is unclear. Here, each cell of the in silico root model carries a copy of the Boolean network, which allows us to test hypotheses and find an explanation.",

    "text": "9.6 Questions\n\nExercise 9.1 Algorithmic thinking\nFamiliarize yourself with the model. Examine Rootfunctions.py to see how each process is modeled and how they are coupled.\n\n\nExercise 9.2 Biology\nWhat happens if you update the network every timestep? Does that make biological sense? Where in the code can you make this modification?\n\n\nExercise 9.3 Biology & algorithmic thinking\nSimulate an auxin treatment by changing the AuxinTreatment parameter. Try values of 10 and 750. This increases auxin levels in all cells by the given amount.\nHow does auxin treatment affect gene expression in the root? (You can visualize different genes by changing the grid provided to plotGrids().)\nDoes the model output correspond to the transcriptional reporter of WOX5 shown in Figure 1? Do you see activation or repression as reported experimentally?\n\n\nExercise 9.4 Biology & algorithmic/mathematical thinking\nThe model does not yet reproduce the experiments. To account for quantitative effects of auxin, implement two hypotheses based on the literature:\nAuxin represses MGP expression.\nExtremely high auxin levels (unrealistic in vivo) repress WOX5 expression.\nModify the equations for MGP and WOX5 in rootNetwork accordingly.\nFor MGP, retain its logical rule but multiply its production term by a saturation function of auxin (Km = 45):\ndMGP = (45/(45+auxininput))((-np.exp(0.5  h) + np.exp(-h * w_MGP)) / ((1 - np.exp(0.5 * h)) * (1 + np.exp(-h * (w_MGP - 0.5))))) - (lambda_ * MGP)\nSimilarly, add a negative regulation by auxin to the WOX5 equation (Km = 1000).\nRun control and auxin treatments with (i) updated MGP, (ii) updated WOX5, and (iii) both updates.\nDo you now see the differences reported by experimentalists?\n\n\nExercise 9.5 Biological interpretation\nYou should observe that WOX5 expression gradually expands into the endodermis and disappears from QC cells when both equations are updated. This matches experimental microscopy. To explain repression:\nWhy do different parts of the root respond differently to auxin? Why does induction occur mainly in upper cells and repression in basal cells?\n\n\nExercise 9.6 Algorithmic thinking\nExperimental repression of WOX5 was detected by RT-PCR at the very apex. Reproduce this in silico by saving the average WOX5 levels of cells at the apex (y &lt; 40) at the end of the simulation for all three treatments. Plot them.\nWhat is the root apex response to auxin treatments? Considering that the root contains mixed cell types, which cells best represent your plotted values?\n\n\nExercise 9.7 Biology & algorithmic thinking\nRepeat the analysis for all cells, for QC cells, and for endodermis cells. Compare WOX5 regulation across tissues.\nDo you see a difference between your observations and the simulated RT-PCR plot? Why?\n\n\nExercise 9.8 Biology & algorithmic thinking\nChanges in WOX5 expression depend on tissue context and auxin dosage. Simulate a range of auxin treatments from 0 to 750 (choose your step size).\nCan you now explain the auxin–WOX5 paradox? What mechanism do you propose?\n\n\nExercise 9.9 Biology & conceptual thinking\nPerform an in silico intervention to alter WOX5 dosage responsiveness. For example, enforce continuous induction or block its induction in the endodermis. How would you test these model predictions experimentally?\n\n\nExercise 9.10 Biological thinking\nAll models are wrong, but some are useful. The model should offer mechanistic insight into paradoxical auxin responses. Yet the original experiments used different auxin analogs: NAA (transported independently of PINs), IAA (PIN-transported), and NPA (blocks PINs, increasing auxin in the apex). How does this information change your conclusions? What extensions to the model would account for these differences?",

    "text": "So far we have largely discussed developmental patterning processes as if they are either occurring under constant environmental conditions or as if environmental conditions have no effect. A minor exception to this is the discussion on robustness of patterning under morphogen gradients, where differences in input of maternal resources, which in turn may depend on food conditions, may impact embryo size and hence scaling is required.\nIn contrast to our discussion so far, environmental conditions may have a major impact on developmental processes. This ranges from the effect of temperature on the body sizes of fruitflies and butterflies, and on the gender of hatching sea turtles, nutritional effects on ant size and worker function to the complete reshaping of organs, organ positioning and body plans in plants. Indeed, while for animals symmetry and scaling are essential for mobility, for plants adaptation to the conditions they find themselves in is of key importance, making developmental plasticity more pervasive in plant development. In the practical we are going to investigate temperature induced leaf hyponasty, in which plants develop leaves with longer petioles (stems) and smaller blades (leaf surface itself) that are positioned in a more upright angle, investigating the adaptive value of this developmental plasticity.\nApart from the question whether plasticity of a developmental process is adaptive, a major question is how this plasticity can be united with robustness. That is, how certain aspects of development can be adjusted, while other aspects can be maintained (i.e. the plant still makes a leaf, that has still a top, bottom, stomata veins, etc but other things are allowed to vary). Additionally, a question is how the networks that drive developmental patterning and e.g. cell fate decisions (Part III) are integrated with networks that sense, process and combine various environmental signals to decide how these developmental processes are to be adjusted. This will be discussed in the lecture.\nIn addition to developmental processes, also physiology, behavior and evolution of course depend on environmental conditions. Examples of the latter two will be discussed in Part V.",

    "text": "11.5 Question 4 - Is Thermomorphogenesis Adaptive?\nThe cooling down of the leaves is often thought to be an important adaptive trait. From the simulations we’ve done so far this is not very clear. It might therefore very well be that we miss important processes in the current model besides the photosynthesis efficiency and maintenance respiration rate. In this last question of the practical you will extent the model with a thermomorphogenic process that you think can play a role in increasing plant growth. This is also an open question in current research, so there is not one correct answer. To help you think, we have come up with some hypothesis you can implement and investigate. Pick one hypothesis to work on and investigate if this would provide an adaptive benefit? If you have extra time, see if you can combine multiple hypotheses.\n\nHypothesis 1 - Day-Night Rhythm\nDuring the night, cooler temperatures reduce maintenance respiration rates, but photosynthesis halts as sunlight is no longer available. To model this, implement the following changes for nighttime conditions:\n\nTemperature drops: Simulate the cooling effect of nighttime.\nNo photosynthesis: Photosynthesis does not occur without sunlight.\nRespiration continues: Maintenance respiration persists despite the absence of photosynthesis.\nHyponasty decreases: Leaf angles return to a less pronounced state.\nAnalyze how the absence of photosynthesis at night affects carbon balance.\nExamine the impact of reduced nighttime temperatures on maintenance respiration rates.\nExplore how changes in leaf angle during the night influence overall plant growth.\n\nAdditionally, plants store carbon during the day to compensate for the lack of photosynthesis at night. Investigate whether this carbon storage provides advantages at specific times of the day or over extended periods. Analyze how these day-night dynamics influence overall plant growth and adaptation.\n\n\nHypothesis 2 - Stomata\nStomata play a critical role in regulating gas exchange and water loss in plants. As leaf temperature increases, stomata open to enhance transpiration, which cools the leaf through evaporative cooling. This mechanism is particularly effective in well-watered plants, where increased stomatal opening can significantly reduce leaf temperature up to around 35°C. However, at very high temperatures, stomata may close to prevent excessive water loss, which can lead to overheating. Additionally, stomatal opening increases photosynthesis rates by improving gas exchange efficiency.\nTo model this, implement the following changes:\n\nStomatal opening increases transpiration: Simulate the cooling effect of transpiration on leaf temperature.\nStomatal opening enhances photosynthesis: Include the effect of improved gas exchange on photosynthesis rates.\nStomatal closure at high temperatures: Model the reduction in cooling and photosynthesis efficiency due to stomatal closure.\nAnalyze how stomatal opening affects leaf cooling and photosynthesis under moderate temperature conditions.\nInvestigate the trade-offs between cooling benefits and photosynthesis efficiency at very high temperatures.\nExamine how stomatal closure impacts plant growth and carbon balance under heat stress.\n\n\n\nHypothesis 3 - Leaf Aspect Ratio\nLeaf size and shape can influence both photosynthesis and respiration rates. Smaller or thinner leaves may reduce maintenance respiration costs due to a lower overall biomass, while potentially maintaining a relatively high photosynthesis rate per unit area. A response often seen during thermomorphogenesis is a change in the ‘leaf-aspect ratio’, where the leaf width decreases but the length stays the same. What is also observed is that leaves become thinner, maintaining their surface area, but decreasing the biomass and thus respiration demand.\nTo model this, implement the following changes:\n\nSmaller and/or thinner leaves reduce respiration costs: Simulate the effect of reduced biomass on maintenance respiration rates.\nLeaf-aspect area changes with temperature: Model the effect of different leaf shapes on effective leaf-area.\nAnalyze how altering leaf thickness and aspect ratio affects plant growth under varying temperature conditions.\nInvestigate the trade-offs between reduced respiration costs and decreased leaf area.\nDetermine if smaller and/or thinner leaves provide an adaptive advantage under heat stress.",

This idea, famously championed by Darwin and Wallace, explains the diversity of life on Earth.

Today, the concept of evolution has expanded beyond biology, it’s recognised as a powerful algorithm that drives adaptation in systems ranging from bacteria (genes) to ideas (memes), from DNA (nucleotides) to computer code (bits).\nIn this part of the course, we’ll bring these ingredients to life by writing our own simulations and watching evolution unfold on the screen.

    "section": "12.4 A simple evolutionary algorithm",
    "text": "12.4 A simple evolutionary algorithm\nOne simple way to simulate evolution is with a Moran process, a classic model from population genetics. Imagine a population of 100 individuals, each with a single gene that determines its fitness. This gene can have all values from 0 to 1 (let’s call this value \\(\\phi\\)). At each time step, one individual is chosen to reproduce with a probability proportional to \\(\\phi\\), producing 1 offspring. This offspring inherits their parents gene (so the same \\(\\phi\\)), but with a probability \\(\\mu\\), the value changes by a small amount (a mutation). The population size will now be 101, which could be interesting if we want to study population growth. However, in a Moran process we keep it simple: one random individual is removed by the new offspring, so the population size is constant while still allowing fitter individuals to spread over time.\nHere’s a minimal Python example:\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nnp.random.seed(5)\n\nN = 100 # Population size \nfitnesses = np.full(N, 0.05)\nmu = 0.01\n# Updated parameters\nsteps = 50000\navg_fitness = []\n\n# Moran process with mutation (logging every 10 steps)\nfor step in range(steps):\n    probs = fitnesses / fitnesses.sum()\n    parent = np.random.choice(N, p=probs)\n    dead = np.random.choice(N)\n\n    # Copy with mutation\n    new_fit = fitnesses[parent]\n    if np.random.rand() &lt; mu:\n        new_fit = np.clip(new_fit + np.random.normal(0, 0.1), 0, 1)\n            \n    fitnesses[dead] = new_fit\n\n    # Save average fitness every 10 steps\n    if step % 10 == 0:\n        avg_fitness.append(fitnesses.mean())\n\n# Plotting\nplt.plot(np.arange(0, steps, 10), avg_fitness)\nplt.xlabel(\"Step\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Average fitness\")\nplt.title(\"Evolution of Fitness in a Moran Process\")\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\nExercise 12.1 (Moran process simulation) \nStudy the Python code for the evolutionary algorithm given above. Answer the following questions:\n\nHow “well adapted” is the initial population?\nHow are mutations implemented in the code? Can you think of other ways?\nCan the parent be replaced by its own offspring? Why/why not?\nTry to decreasing/increase value of \\(\\mu\\) (mutation rate). Which values makes evolution go faster? Which values make evolution more precise?\n\n\n\nAnswer  a. Looking at the output or at the code, we see that the initial population has a “fitness” of 0.05.  b. Mutations are implemented by adding a normally distributed random number (mean 0, std 0.1) to the parent’s fitness value with a probability of mu. This comes down to sampling from a normal distribution with the mean set to the parent’s value. Other ways could include using a uniform distribution for mutations, making every jump equally likely.  c. Yes, the parent can be replaced by its own offspring if the random individual chosen to die happens to be the parent. This is possible because the death selection is random and independent of fitness.  d. Increasing mutation rates makes it easier to find fitter mutants when the population is not (yet) adapted, so evolution goes faster. However, it is also less “precise”, as the average of the population will fluctuate well below the optimal fitness of 1.",

Combining that with a function that draws an arrow in Python, we get the following code:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCODE FOR “moving vector in Python”\n\n\n\n\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Enable interactive mode for matplotlib\nplt.ion()\n\n# Setup figure and axis for plotting the arrow\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 4))\nax.set_xlim(0, 600)  # x-axis limits\nax.set_ylim(0, 250)  # y-axis limits\nax.set_aspect('equal')  # Keep aspect ratio square\nax.set_facecolor('#f0f0f0')  # Background color\nax.set_title(\"A moving vector with an arrowhead\")  # Title\n\n# Initial position and velocity\nx, y = 250.0, 180.0      # Position coordinates\nvx, vy = 5.0, 10.5        # Velocity components\n\n\ndef draw_arrow(x, y, vx, vy):\n    \"\"\"\n    Draws an arrow at position (x, y) with velocity (vx, vy).\n    \"\"\"\n    ax.clear()\n    ax.set_xlim(0, 600)\n    ax.set_ylim(0, 250)\n    ax.set_aspect('equal')\n    ax.set_facecolor('#f0f0f0')\n    ax.set_title(\"A moving vector with an arrowhead\")\n\n    # Normalize velocity for drawing the arrow\n    \n    dx = vx*5\n    dy = vy*5\n\n    # Arrow shaft\n    end_x = x + dx\n    end_y = y + dy\n\n    # Arrowhead calculation\n    angle = np.arctan2(dy, dx)\n    angle_offset = np.pi / 7\n    hx1_x = end_x - np.cos(angle - angle_offset)\n    hx1_y = end_y - np.sin(angle - angle_offset)\n    hx2_x = end_x - np.cos(angle + angle_offset)\n    hx2_y = end_y - np.sin(angle + angle_offset)\n\n    # Draw shaft\n    ax.quiver(x, y, dx, dy, angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='#007acc', width=0.005)\n    # Draw base point\n    ax.plot(x, y, 'o', color='#333')\n\n    # Labels\n    ax.text(x+10, y+10, f\"x = {x:.2f}\")\n    ax.text(x+10, y-5, f\"y = {y:.2f}\")\n    ax.text(end_x + 10, end_y - 20, f\"vₓ = {vx:.2f}\")\n    ax.text(end_x + 10, end_y, f\"vᵧ = {vy:.2f}\")\n\n    plt.draw()\n    plt.pause(0.03)\n\n# Animation loop: update position by velocity\nfor i in range(500):\n    x += vx*0.1  # Update x position\n    y += vy*0.1  # Update y position\n\n    # Wrap around edges\n    x %= 600\n    y %= 250\n    \n    draw_arrow(x, y, vx, vy)\n\nplt.ioff()\n\n\n\n\nExercise 13.1 (Playing with steering arrows - Mathematical thinking) \nCopy-paste the code above, study it for a few minutes, and run it.\n\nWhat can you do to make the arrow accelerate?\n\nTo rotate a vector, we can use the following trigonometrical equations, where \\(\\theta\\) is the angle of rotation:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nx_{new} = x \\cdot cos(\\theta) - y \\cdot sin(\\theta) \\newline\ny_{new} = x \\cdot sin(\\theta) + y \\cdot cos(\\theta)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] b. Use the equation above to rotate the velocity vector in the code by a small angle every timestep. What happens? c. Modelling 1 individual is not very exciting. Think about what the code above would look like if you had more than 1 individual. Discuss this with other students and/or Bram.\n\n\nAnswers a. For this, you can simply multiply the velocity components every timestep by a value &gt; 1. For example:\n# Accellerate the velocity\nvx *= 1.01\nvy *= 1.01\nNote that this gets out of hand quite quickly. b. To do this, we need to store the new values in a temporary variable, and then assign them to the original variables. This is necessary because while we first modify vx, we still want to use the ‘old’ value of vx to calculate the new vy. The following code rotates the velocity vector by 0.05 radians:\n# Rotate the velocity vector by a small angle \nvxnew = vx * np.cos(0.05) - vy * np.sin(0.05)\nvynew = vx * np.sin(0.05) + vy * np.cos(0.05)\nvx, vy = vxnew, vynew\n\n\nIf you run this code, you will see that the dot will go in circles.\n\n\n\nWhile the code above stores x, y, vx, and vy as a ‘global variables’, this is not good if we have many individuals. Instead, we can store the state of each individual in a list, dictionary, or a class. For example, we make a class ‘cell’ and store 100 of these ‘cells’ in a large list:\n\nclass Cell:\n    def __init__(self, x, y, vx, vy):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n        self.vx = vx\n        self.vy = vy\n# Create 100 cells\ncells = [Cell(np.random.rand(), np.random.rand(), 0.0, 0.0) for _ in range(100)]",

Let’s make the target change position around after an individual touches it.\n\nExercise 13.2 (Playing with steering arrows - Algorithmic/mathematical thinking) To help you on your way, first answer the following questions for yourself:\n\nHow can you calculate the distance between an individual and the orange dot?\nWhen is an individual close enough to the orange dot?\nHow can we assign a random position to the dot?\n\n\nA working code to steer the individuals towards the target is shown below. Note that the acceleration that is applied is only small, otherwise the individuals will move in a straight line towards the target very rapidly.\nFirst try it yourself.

Note that I decided to first throw an individual away, and then add the newborn individual (instead of the other way around). This ensures the newborn cannot be immediately thrown away, which would be a rather pointless event.\ndef reproduce_cell(self, cell):\n       # Reproduce: Create a new cell with the same properties as the current cell\n       angle = np.random.uniform(0, 2 * np.pi)\n       radius = np.random.uniform(0.05, 1.5)\n       new_x = cell.x + radius * np.cos(angle)\n       new_y = cell.y + radius * np.sin(angle)\n       new_cell = Cell(new_x, new_y, cell.vx, cell.vy)\n       random_cell = np.random.choice(self.cells)   \n       self.cells.remove(random_cell)\n       self.cells.append(new_cell)\n\nNote that depending on the scenario, the above questions may change. When a planktonic algea reproduces the daughter cells may inherit the velocity of the mother cell, but if a monkey gives birth, it does not make a lot of sense to talk about the ‘velocity’ of the mother. If we consider plants, we should not even consider velocity of the individuals at any stage of their life.",

Let’s use the function np.exp to calculate a Gaussian that we will place in the center of the grid. The fill_grid already takes as arguments the grid, a relative x-coordinate (0-1), a relative y-coordinate (0-1), and a standard deviation (0-1).

    "text": "13.6 Run and tumble\n\n\n\n“Run and tumble”\n\n\nBacterial cells are so small, that they cannot detect a gradient directly (in other words, they don’t know in which direction resources are higher!). Instead, bacteria often use a “run and tumble” strategy. When they are currently not detecting an increase in the concentration (over time), they tumble. If they do detect an increase, they keep moving in the same direction. This is a very simple strategy, but it can be very effective mechanism for chemotaxis.\nIn our earlier code of a single, moving vector, we rotated the arrow by changing the ‘angle’ variable. However, these cells do not have an angle parameters, but only a velocity vector with components \\(v_x\\) and \\(v_y\\). If we want to rotate the velocity vector, we can use the following equation (rooted in basic trigonometry):\n\\[\nv_x' = v_x \\cdot cos(\\theta) - v_y \\cdot sin(\\theta) \\\\\nv_y' = v_x \\cdot sin(\\theta) + v_y \\cdot cos(\\theta)\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\theta\\) is the angle we want the vector to rotate (in radians, not degrees!), and \\(v_x\\) and \\(v_y\\) are the components of the vector. With this in mind, let’s try and model chemotaxis.\n\nExercise 13.6 (Run and tumble - Biology / algorithmic thinking)  \n\nDetermine the concentration at the position of the cell, AND the predicted position of the cell after a small timestep (hint: use \\(v_x\\) and \\(v_y\\) to predict the future position! ask Bram if you get stuck)\nMake sure the future position is not outside of the grid! (hint: use Google, ChatGPT, or Copilot and figure out how the “modulo” operator works)\nIf the future position has a higher concentration than the current position, keep moving in more or less the same direction, with a very small change.\nIf the future position is a lower concentration, rotate the velocity vector a lot.\n\n\n\nAnswer A working code to implement a run-and-tumble mechanism shown below:\ndef find_peak(self, cell):\n       # Convert cell position to grid indices, as well as the previous position\n       grid_x = int(cell.x) % WORLD_SIZE\n       grid_y = int(cell.y) % WORLD_SIZE\n       next_x = (int(cell.x + 10*cell.vx) + WORLD_SIZE) % WORLD_SIZE \n       next_y = (int(cell.y + 10*cell.vy) + WORLD_SIZE) % WORLD_SIZE \n       # Get the resource value at cell's position, as well as the next position\n       resource_value = self.grid[grid_x, grid_y]\n       resource_next = self.grid[next_x, next_y]\n       \n       # Check if the cell is moving in the right direction\n       if resource_next &gt; resource_value:\n           # Moving in the right direction: small random adjustment\n           angle = np.random.uniform(-0.1, 0.1)  # Small angle change\n       else:\n           # Moving in the wrong direction: large random adjustment\n           angle = np.random.uniform(-np.pi*1.0, np.pi*1.0)  # Large angle change\n       \n       # Rotate the velocity vector by the angle calculated\n       new_vx = cell.vx * np.cos(angle) - cell.vy * np.sin(angle)\n       new_vy = cell.vx * np.sin(angle) + cell.vy * np.cos(angle)\n   \n       # Update the acceleration with the new velocity vector\n       cell.vx = new_vx\n       cell.vy = new_vy\n       cell.ax += cell.vx\n       cell.ay += cell.vy\n\nStudy if your individuals can find the resource peak.

Also go back to the starting code again (without all the additions), and run this code with 1000 or cells too.\n\nExercise 13.7 (Algorithmic / computational thinking)  \n\nWhat happens? Can you explain this?\n\n\n\nAnswer It becomes quite slow, and in the microbial world 1000 cells is not all that much… The earlier code without all the collision and stickiness did not have such a noticable slowing down. This is because the collision and stickiness functions both loop over all cells for each cell. For 1000 cells, this results in 1,000,000 interactions to check per timestep, which can be quite slow in Python. In other words, because we have to compare everyone with everyone, a 10-fold increase in the number of cells results in a 100-fold increase in the computation time. Not ideal.\n\nThis is far as this introduction to IBMs in python goes. Simple IBMs can be efficiently implemented in basic Python, but for more complex models, it is better to i) use numpy operations to speed up your Python code, or ii) use a faster programming language like C, Rust, or Javascript. For the last part of this pratical, we will study the Javascript version of this model. But before that, here is the final code that I ended up with:",

    "text": "13.10 Exploring the full Javascript model with evolution\nThe full model is implemented in Javascript, and can be found here.\nIn this full model, cells also reproduce every once in a while (when a “season” ends). Their reproductive success is shaped by the amount of resources at that position. Every time a cell reproduces there it inherits the parents stickiness, but it can also change this value a bit. This way, stickiness is an “evolvable” property on which natural selection will act. How much each cell is attracted to nearby cells depends on an internal “stickiness” parameter. Let the simulation run for some time.\n\nExercise 13.8 (The evolution of stickiness - Biology)  \n\nWhat happens to the evolution of stickiness?\nIdentify multiple advantages and disadvantages of stickiness.\nGiven your answer in b., can you name an important parameter that may determine the balance bewteen the advantages and disadvantages of stickiness? See if you can test it using the options provided.\n\n\n\nAnswer a. In the full model, stickiness evolves to be higher. Because we select for individuals that find the resource peaks, we can state that natural selection favours stickiness. There is however a limit to this, as stickiness does not go beyond ~0.25.  b. The advantages of stickiness are that larger groups of cells are better at steering towards the resources. Even if a single cell tries to randomly go in the wrong direction (due to its tumbling mechanic), it will be pulled back. In other words, together these cells are far less sensitive to noise. Another distinct advantage you may have noticed is that the stickiest cells are sorted to be in the center of the group (as you have already seen earlier in this course!). That means that even after the peak was found, the stickiest cells have an advantage over the other cells as they can occupy the peak of the resource distribution. The disadvantages of stickiness are that larger groups clearly move more slowly, and that the sticky clusters tend to stay together even if there are many resource peaks (and therewith miss out on resources).  c. The duration of the seasonal cycle is very important. If it is very long, it does not matter that the large clusters move slowly, as they will be better at finding and staying on the peak by being sticky. If the cycle is however very short, it may be more important to be able to move quickly and change direction rapidly. In that case, being too sticky may be a problem. As you modify this parameter in the online model, you will indeed see that shorter seasons mostly cause stickiness to drift close to 0.0, while longer seasons cause stickiness to evolve towards 0.25 or even higher.",

    "text": "14.2 Simple model where fitness as a number\nIn the introduction of this course part on evolution, we have already looked at as simple “Moran process”:\n\nStart with a population of individuals, each with a fitness value.\nSelect individuals based on their fitness to reproduce.\nReplace a random individual with this newly generate offspring.\nWith a small probability, modify the ‘fitness’ value of the newborn.\n\nAnd so on.\nWith a Moran process, competition between individuals is modelled in a very indirect (“implicit”) way. By always selecting fit individuals, and removing a random other, any individual in the populations could be replaced by another individual, which statistically is a fitter individual. One could thus say that “everyone is competing with everyone”. A different method is often applied in spatially structured models, as in this case only nearby individuals are competing. Then, we could sample who wins from an imaginary roulette wheel:\n\nAs can be seen, not all individual have the same size on the roulette wheel. That depicts differences in their growth rates, biomass, or other approximations of “fitness”. Also, the roulette wheel contains an area (shown in black) that shapes the chance that nobody reproduces. We will try and implement this rule to let individuals reproduce based on their fitness, but with only 10 competitors at a time.

There are many ways to implement this, but here’s how we will do it. We will sample N individuals from the population, and implement the following algorithm:\n\nSelect a random subset of N individuals from the population.\nTake/compute the fitness of each selected individual.\nAdd a reproduction-skip option with a fixed weight.\nChoose one individual or the skip option using weighted random selection.\nIf an individual was chosen, mutate it and replace a random individual in the population.\n\nBelow, there’s a small snippet of code doing what is explained above1. The variable no_reproduction_chance is the fixed weight that nobody gets to reproduce:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoulette wheel algorithm\n\n\n\n\n\n  tournament_size = 10  \n  no_reproduction_chance = 1\n  \n  competitors = random.sample(population, tournament_size)\n  # Make a list of their fitness values\n  fitness_values = [fit for fit in competitors]\n  total = sum(fitness_values)\n  # Add a \"no reproduction\" dummy competitor with fitness = 0\n  competitors_with_dummy = competitors + [None]\n  probs = [f / total for f in fitness_values] + [no_reproduction_chance]\n  winner = random.choices(competitors_with_dummy, weights=probs, k=1)[0]\n  if winner is not None:\n      # Mutate winner to produce offspring\n      offspring = mutate(winner)\n      remove_idx = random.randrange(len(population))\n      population[remove_idx] = offspring  \n        \n\n\n\nAfter you understand the roulette wheel algorithm, do the following exercise:\n\nExercise 14.1 (Questions about the roulette wheel - Algorithmic thinking) \n\nLet’s imagine a moment where the roulette wheel contains only 10 highly unfit individuals (e.g. all fitness values are 0.01). What is the chance that someone will reproduce? (you don’t have to calculate it, but give your reasoning)\nAnswer the same question as in a., but now imagine that all 10 individuals have a fitness value of 1.\nAnswer question b. and c. again, but now assume that no_reproduction_chance is equal to 0.\nDescribe what the no_reproduction_chance parameter does in biological terms.\nSpatially structured populations are often placed on a grid. Describe how you could implement a roulette wheel to resolve local competition, e.g. when an empty grid point is competed for by the neighbours.\n\n\n\nAnswer a. If we sample 10 unfit individuals, the weight of the no_reproduction_event is proportionally high (the black slice of the roulette wheel is big). Hence, there is only a small chance that anyone will reproduce to begin with. b. If we sample 10 fit individuals (fitness 1), the chances are much higher that someone will reproduce. c. If the dummy value is 0, the chances that someone will reproduce are the same in both scenarios, as even with very unfit individuals there is no chance that nobody reproduces. d. In nature, if no individual is sufficiently fit, reproduction may not occur at all. For example, if the competing individuals are bacteria with very low glucose uptake rates, they may not yet be physiologically ready to reproduce. In such cases, population size should remain stable or even decline if death is also occurring. The no_reproduction_event captures this by ensuring that fitness is not judged solely in relative terms against other individuals, but also in absolute terms against environmental demands. e. If a grid point is empty (contains no individual), make a list of (up to) 8 individuals around that grid point. Apply the roulette wheel for those individuals, and place the ‘winner’ inside the empty grid point.",

Describe the pattern verbally.\n\n\n\nAnswer A snippet to calculate the standard deviation of a population is shown below. Note that this value is already being plotted, so if you modify this function you ought to be able to see what happens immediately.\ndef calculate_diversity(population):\n   \"\"\"Calculate diversity as the standard deviation of fitness values.\"\"\"\n   mean = sum(population) / len(population)\n   variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in population) / (len(population) - 1)\n   return math.sqrt(variance)\n\nThe green dotted line is the standard deviation of the values in the population (‘diversity’). From this we can see that the population is only briefly diverse whenever a new, fit individual appears. In between these phases, diversity is 0. This makes intuitive (biological) sense, as with a low mutation rate the only moments where there is more than 1 species is during the invasion of a new mutant. During all other phases, there is just a single (fittest) species.",

What does the new (dashed blue) line represent? Do you understand how is changes over time?\n\nThe program reports after how many generations it manages to find the target sequence. With default settings this can take a long time… (default: 429 generations)\n\nModify the mutation rate to see how it affects the time to find the target sequence. Try different mutation rates between 0.0001 and 0.1. Keep track of both how long (number of generations) it takes to find the target, and how fit the population is once the target is found. What do you observe?\nDiversity is no longer calculated as the standard deviation in fitness, but as the Shannon diversity of all present sequences (although it is not super complex, you do not need to fully understand this function). Because of this, the exact number (quantities) cannot be compared to our ealrier model. Do you see a qualitative differences?\nStudy how fitness is calculated in this model. Is there a distinction between genotype en phenotype? Why/why not?\n\n\n\nAnswer a. The new blue dotted line represents how many mutations are beneficial (towards the target). As the population gets closer to the target, the number of beneficial mutations decreases. As such, this line is a mirror image of the fitness in the population. We will look a bit deeper into this line in the next model.  b. Generally speaking, a higher mutation rate helps to find the target faster. However, with high mutation rates (0.01 or higher), the fitness after the target is found starts to decrease, as individual produce many (unfit) mutants. In fact, if mutation rate is too high (approximately 0.04 or higher), the population fails to find the target at all, as reproduction is too inaccurate! This concept is known as the ‘Error Threshold’ or the ‘Error Catastrophe’ in evolutionary biology.  c. Qualitatively, there is no clear difference to what we saw before: diversity only peaks at moments when there is a new mutant coming in, but otherwise diversity is still 0. d. There is no distinction between genotype and phenotype. Fitness is directly calculated from the DNA sequence, so there is no ‘genotype-to-phenotype mapping’.",

What new information can you obtain from analysing this line?\nStudy carefully how the other lines (also present in previous models) change over time. What do you observe? Try and capture what you see into words.\nIn biology, multiple genotypes can translate to the same phenotype (this is called a many-to-one genotype-phenotype map), or alternatively, one genotype can produce multiple phenotype (this is called phenotypic plasticity, or a one-to-many genotype-phenotype map). Which genotype-phenotype (GP) mapping applies to this model? Why?\nBonus question for motivated students modify the code to include a second target protein sequence, and alternate between the two targets. If you see something interesting, please share it with the class!\n\n\n\nAnswer a. The new black line is the maximum fitness in the population. Thanks to this line we can see that, sometimes, an individual is present that is fitter but it does not manage to take over the population. We are dealing with a stochastic process, so this is very natural.  b. The fitness line once again goes in distinct steps. The diversity line (green dotted) has a distinct behaviour compared to earlier models. Instead of only going up during the discovery of a new mutant, it constantly creeps up during periods where fitness does not change. This is because the codon-table is partially redundant: many different DNA sequences can code for the same amino acid sequence, so diveristy increases. However, when a new “fitter” individual comes in, diversity goes down as that individual clonally takes over the population. Then, diversity slowly increases again. A similar pattern is reflected in the line that represents the “beneficial mutations” (blue dotted line). TLDR; even when fitness is not changing there is still a lot going on in this population! c. This model represents a many-to-one mapping between genotype and phenotype. The DNA sequence (genotype) is translated into an amino acid sequence (phenotype), which is then used to calculate fitness. This means that many different genotypes can lead to the same phenotype, and thus the same fitness. Earlier in this course you have learned about development, and those processes often lead to effects where the same genotype can produce many different shapes (phenotypes).  d. BONUS: I have not personally done this, and I do not know the answer to this question yet. However, it is sometimes observed that with many-to-one mapping, populations can because better and better at switching between two alternating targets. This is because the alternating selection pressures make populations move towards genotypes that are “close” to both targets, and because there is some neutrality coding this can be acchieved without losing fitness in either environment. For cool paper on this principle, see Crombach and Hogeweg (2008). I suspect however that our current model will not be able to do the same.\n\n\n\n\n\nCrombach, Anton, and Paulien Hogeweg. 2008. “Evolution of Evolvability in Gene Regulatory Networks.” PLoS Computational Biology 4 (7): e1000112.",

    "text": "15.2 Simulating a simple microbial ecosystem with “public goods”\n\nModel description\nMicrobes often produce public goods, from which surrounding microbes can benefit. This can lead to interesting dynamics, such as cooperation and competition. Most models however consider on 1 public good at a time, which leads to limited diversity (a producer, and a non-producer may or may not coexist). Here, we will an ecosystem with many public goods, and simulate them on a grid.\nAn individual microbe will carry a “genome” that is represented by a binary string (101010010011). Each position in the string represents a public good, and whether the individual can produce it (1) or not (0). The individual can rely on other individuals to produce public goods.\nWe will simulate individuals (microbial cells) reproducing and dying on a grid. A grid point either contains an individual, or it is empty. Every empty point, will be competed for by individuals that are in that neighbourhood. The neighbourhood is defined as the 8 surrounding grid points (this is called the “Moore” neighbourhood). The cells can only replicate if they have all the public goods they need, which means that they can rely on other individuals in their neighbourhood to produce them. If they do not have all public goods available, they cannot replicate. The “winner” from these (max) 8 viable competitors will be determined by a roulette wheel selection, where the relative probability is determined by their fitness:\n\\[\nF_i = 1 - c \\cdot \\sum({bitstring})\n\\]\nIn other words, fitness goes down as the number of public goods produced increases, and there is a cost \\(c\\) associated with producing each public good. Make sure this roulette wheel contains a probability that nobody wins, such that highly unfit individuals are less likely to replicate than highly fit individuals (also see earlier practicals).\nThe individual that replicates, can undergo mutations in the bitstring (gene loss and gene gain). Assume gene loss is more likely than gene gain (initial parameters to explore are summarised below)\nFinally, implement a function that allows you to mix the grid (all individuals are placed in a random position).\n\n\nModel output\nThe model will have the following output: a grid that is coloured by the number of public goods produced (for consistency, let’s all use a ‘viridis’ scale), and a line graph that plots the total population sizes, as well as the population sizes of species producing 0 public goods, 1 public good, 2 public goods, etc. (see Figure 15.1)\n\n\nParameters to start out with\n\nGrid size: 50 x 50\nInitial population: produces all public goods (1111…1)\nDeath rate: 0.1\nCost (c): 0.05\nBitstring 1 to 0 mutation (losing a gene): 0.01\nBitstring 0 to 1 mutation (gaining a gene): 0.001\nNumber of public goods (i.e. bitstring length): 10\n“No-event” size of roulette wheel: 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.1: Example of what the simulation could look like\n\n\n\n\n\nProposed experiments\nTry investigating how the model behaves with different values of \\(c\\) (the cost of producing public goods). Can you explain what happens at \\(c=0.0\\)?\nTry studying the effect of mixing the whole grid every timestep, such that neighbourhoods are constantly “randomised”. Look at the population size, as well as the distribution of different types. Can you explain the observations in biological terms?\nTry studying what happens at different mutation rates.\n\nAnswer This practical is quite open-ended, so instead of answers it is more useful to have a scientific discussion. The image below was first run on a spatially structured grid, but from the dashed line onwards the grid was mixed every timestep. From this we can see that it matters “who you compete with”. On the spatial grid, individuals compete mostly with other individuals of their own species. That means that, on average, they cannot complement each other by providing public goods (they produce the same set!). Because of this, the “omni-producers” (yellow line) dominates, surrounded by a cloud of mutants that rely on other types. The population size fluctuates strongly, as local populations can collapse due to the loss of public goods, typically followed by the “omni-producers” once again invading the available niche space (empty space on the grid).  When mixing the grid every time step, who you interact with is randomised, and individuals can now rely on other genotypes in the population. Although there is some luck involved in this, you can see that the total population (the black line) increases from this point onward. Thus, although the omni-producers are less dominant, statistically individuals are much better off in this mixed world. That said, there is a risk to this mixed population: if the cost of producing public goods is too high, the population can collapse as there is a strong incentive to lose production of public goods and start relying on others. Depending on your implementation, you may find that mixed systems therefor perform better or worse than spatially structured systems. If they behave identically though, let me (Bram) know, as that is something I almost never observe in models like this ;)",

    "section": "",
    "text": "16.1 Mini description\nIn semi-arid areas, instead of a spatially continuous vegetation pattern, shrubs and bushes typically occur in a spot, stripe, labyrinthine or inverted spot pattern with the pattern type depending on the availability of water and the severity of grazing by cattle (Figure 1). These vegetation patterns are thought to arise from a positive effect of plant presence on water infiltration in the soil and vice versa from soil water to plant growth, giving rise to a positive feedback loop.\nOne of the models frequently used for these water-vegetation systems is described by the following set of 3 equations:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}N}{\\mathrm{d}t} = rN(1 - \\frac{N}{K})\n\\tag{16.1}\\]\nAnd Equation A.1 is a reference to the equation above.\nThe model has three variables, O = surface water, W = soil water and P is plant biomass.\nThe parameters are R=rainfall, alpha=maximum uptake of surface water to become soil water, W0= the plant biomass independent fraction of surface water uptake, k2 =saturation constant determining how much plant biomass you need to reach half maximum plant mediated surface water uptake, gmax = the maximum uptake of soil water by plants, k1=saturation constant of the soil water level at which this uptake is half maximum, rw = soil water loss due to evaporation, c=factor for the conversion of uptaken water into plant biomass, and d=decay rate of plant biomass.\nClassically, it was thought that the positive feedback between water and plants gives rise to a bistable system in which at a certain point, a further gradual decrease in water level or increase in cattle grazing could lead to the sudden collapse of the vegetation, a phenomenon referred to as a catastrophic bifurcation or tipping point. Furthermore, it was thought transitions in spatial patterning could be interpreted as warning signs for the system becoming closer to this point of sudden collapse (Fig 2A). More recent mathematical analysis instead suggests that spatial patterning may allow for a more gradual transition from high to low vegetation levels without the occurrence of sudden transitions (Fig2B).\nIn this project you will investigate for the given equations which of the two situations apply for this model. Since we are not mathematicians, we will go about this in a predominantly numerical manner. First let us study the type of behavior the bove given model generates. For this you can use the python code ……. Investigate how the type of pattern, but also the average vegetation density changes as a function of rainfall, and whether you think the changes you observe reflect a catastrophic transition or rather a gradual change. Hint: Start with a rainfall level of 0.7 and increment by 0.1. Once you find patterns you can go back and use smaller steps to find the precise transition point. Once you find homogeneous patterns you can do 2 more 0.1 increments and then stop. Note that you will need to write additional code to quantify average levels, pattern characteristics etc. Analyse whether there is a critical transition or not.\nBelow R=1 no patterns, boundary at R=1.02. At that point P=4.7 so transition in terms of levels is sudden\nNow investigate the dependence of vegetation on rainfall in a non-spatial setting where Turing patterns can not occur. If we want to do things like a phase plane analysis, enabling us to study e.g. if our model is bistable, which equilibria are stable, and how this changes when we change parameters (i.e. to understand our sudden transitions in vegetation levels), we often try to reduce our models to 2D. So let us try to simplify the given 3D model to 2D by using a so-called QSSA (quasi steady state assumption) for the surface water. (Hint: To do so write dO/dt=0 and solve this for O, which gives you an algebraic equation. Now you can drop the dO/dt equation and in the other equations, substitute O for this algebraic equation.) Analyse this model using an R package called Grind that is made for analysing ODE models:……..\nYou can check the outcomes of this analysis by running the spatial python code and put all the slow diffusion parameters to the value of the fast diffusion parameter. Analyse whether you observe a critical transition as function of rainfall or not.\nThe fold bifurcation occurs at R=1.17 so earlier than in the spatial model. The fold bifurcation occurs at a vegetation level of 2 something so lower than for the spatial model. Also range of R with bistability is quite limited, already soon you get a transcritical bifurcation.\nIn the model we used here, spatial patterns allow vegetation to persist at lower rainfall levels (no vegetation below R=1 instead of R=1.17), however the transition from vegetation to no vegetation is actually more sudden (veg=4.7 instead of 2 something). So we are neither in the situation of Fig2A nor Fig2B but in a third combined situation where transitions in vegetation pattern do warn for collapse (Fig 2A), but also postpone yet not gradualize the collapse (Fig 2B).\nIn Madagascar people are trying to combat deforestation not by planting small trees, but by digging so-called foxholes, shallow round holes in the ground that are more or less evenly spaced across the terrain where they put in tree seeds in the holes. Due to their somewhat increased depth the foxholes receive more water than their environment, thus locally promoting germination and plant growth. It is said that this approach is more efficient and successful than simply planting trees.\nLet us consider a situation where vegetation is absent. Let us now compare two approaches, one in which little trees are planted uniformly, and one in which even tinier trees (i.e. germinating seeds) are placed in potholes where local water conditions are more favorable. Determine in your model, using the same equations as before what vegetation density level is necessary for homogeneous planting as an initial condition to result in a stable vegetated state. Next compare this to planting tiny plants in potholes. You can play with the size of the potholes and their numbers, as well as the precise level of starting vegetation within them and the regulatory of their positioning. To simplify the comparison you may do so for a single rainfall level “R”. Make sure to choose a value for R that allowed for vegetation in the spatial model\nWhen implementing the potholes some programming is required to create circles with certain sizes and pattern them either regularly or irregularly and at different distances\nWater conditions are better in the potholes, this can be achieved by localling making the “R” level higher or have preferential diffusion or convection of water towards them\nFor master students. Increase the value of alpha in the spatial model. Study again how vegetation patterns depend on rainfall level. Asses what happened to model outcomes and provide an explanation.\nIf alpha is high the infiltration is fast and hence the positive feedback loop is no longer local. As a consequence spatial patterning disappears and the system behaves like the non-spatial one.",

    "text": "17.1 Mini description\nMicrobes often form intricate relationships, not only amongst each other, but also with larger organisms from all kingdoms: plants, animals, and fungi. While they often provide useful services, microbes typically evolve much faster than these hosts. What stops a microbe from taking advantage of its host, taking more resources than it provides, or even damaging the host tissue to gain access to even more resources? The latter scenario, we would call a pathogen, and the likelyhood of this transition from occuring could be called the disease pressure.\nUnderstanding the fundamental principles behind disease pressure can help mitigating disease outbreaks. For example, if we understand the conditions under which a microbe is likely to become a pathogen, we can take steps to prevent this from happening.\nTo phrase the above story a little differently: the microbes in our gut or in the soil of our favourite crops, are constantly evolving on a parasitism-mutualism continuum (see Figure 17.1). In this mini project, you will investigate the dynamics of microbiomes evolving on such a continuum. We will particularly focus on how the properties of the host (plant, animals, etc.) shape the likelihood of disease outbreaks. To that end, here are a few key questions to get you started, but you don’t need to focus on each and every one of them at the same time.

They show that the evolution of self-sacrificing microbes (which they call “helpers”) is highly sensitive to the host’s longevity and transmission of microbes in between hosts (horizontal transmission). To understand why, start by reading their paper. If you have read it, unfold the text below to see my summary of their methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy summary of the model by van Vliet et al.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis model studies the maintanance of self-sacrificial “helper” microbes. Here, I will refer to helpers as “allies” (A), as to clearly differentiate it from “hosts” (H). Microbes that are not allies are referred to as neutral (N).\nAllies provide a benefit to their host, while neutral microbes do not. The microbes are modelled with simple ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\color{#555}{\n\\frac{dN}{dt} =\n\\underbrace{rN}_{\\textrm{Growth N}} -\n\\underbrace{\\delta N(A+N)}_{\\textrm{Density-dependent death}}\n}\\\\\n\\color{green}{\n  \\frac{dA}{dt} =\n  \\underbrace{rA(1-\\gamma)}_{\\textrm{Growth A}} -\n  \\underbrace{\\delta A(A+N)}_{\\textrm{Density-dependent death}}\n}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1}\n\\] As you can see, allies grow slower than neutral microbes and are therefore at a competitive disadvantage, and will eventually be outcompeted. To counter-act the loss of allies, van Vliet’s model considers selection at the level of the host. To achieve this, the birth rate of hosts (\\(B_i\\)) depends on the frequency of allies A in the microbiome:\n\\[\nB_i = \\frac{r}{G_H}(1+s_b\\cdot \\frac{A}{A+N})\n\\]\nHere, \\(G_H\\) is a parameter that scales the host generation time w.r.t. the growth rate of microbes (\\(r\\)), with \\(G_H \\gg r\\) ensuring hosts are long-lived compared to microbes. The term \\(s_b\\) is the maximum benefit that hosts get from carrying the ally strain.\nThe death rate of hosts (\\(D_i\\)) increases linearly with the density of hosts at any given time (\\(H(t)\\)), and is given by:\n\\[\nD_i = \\frac{r}{G_H} \\frac{H(t)}{K_H}\n\\]\nWhere \\(H(t)\\) gives the number of hosts at a given time, and \\(K_H\\) denotes the basal carrying capacity in the absence of allies. Note that the true carrying capacity can be higher, as helpers increase the birth rate of hosts.\nWhenever a host reproduces, the microbiome is transmitted vertically to their offspring. The frequency of allies in the offspring is sampled from a normal distribution with mean \\(f_A\\):\n\\[\nf_{offspring}  = \\mathcal{N} (f_{A},\\sigma^2),\n\\\\\\text{with } f_A = \\frac{A}{A+N}\n\\]\nTo avoid negative ally frequencies, this number is truncated such that \\(0&lt;A_{offspring}&lt;1\\). The total density in the newborn is set by another parameter \\(n_0\\). The model by van Vliet also considers “horizontal” transmission of microbiomes, where \\(f_A\\) is not the ally frequency in the parent, but the frequency of allies in the microbiome of a random individual.\nSo far so good with all the math. Now the simulation…\n\nThe simulation loop\n\nThe birth and death rates of all hosts is calculated\nCalculate the probability of a host-level event (birth/death) occurring\nIf an event occurs, draw a random event proportional to its probability.\nExecute the event sampled in step 3\nUpdate all the microbiome ODEs.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo start the project, we will first replicate van Vliet’s results in Python. As a guideline, use my model summary above. I am ready to help where needed, but at this point in the course your experience should go a long way! If the simulation works, see if you can reproduce the following two figures:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Allies are maintained within a population of hosts (black line shows the average), despite each individual host (green thinner lines) constantly decreasing in ally types.

Note that so far, we have only discussed “helpers” and “neutral” microbes, but the same principles apply to pathogens but perhaps a little more extreme. For example, the microbes may evolve such high levels of nastiness, that hosts do not only replicate slower, but die.

    "section": "",
    "text": "18.1 Mini description\nAuxin is a plant hormone that regulates a great diversity of processes in plants. Auxin can move between cells through the activity of membrane proteins acting as auxin efflux and influx transporters, allowing the coordination of cells. In the cells, auxin activates a signalling pathway in which a family of transcription factors, the auxin response factors (ARF), activate or repress gene expression. To study the role of auxin on plant development, experimentalists have found several ways to impinge on the different steps preceding auxin responses. For example, auxin levels can be increased using a synthetic auxin molecule (NAA) or by inhibiting the activity of the PIN transporters (N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid, NPA), while auxin responses can be actively elicited by interfering directly with components the auxin signalling pathway.\nIn the root, WOX5 regulation by auxin has been studied using these three strategies. The model we used in Practical 6 makes a rather coarse representation of the auxin treatments by increasing the auxin levels equally in all cells. Yet, the actual treatments made experimentally may affect auxin levels and responses in very different ways. Here you will extend the model we used before, by implementing each of these strategies and compare how each intervention modifies WOX5 expression in time and space.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "19.1 Mini description\nIn the early C. elegans embryo, the first cell division of the zygote (P0 cell) is asymmetric. The anterior daughter forms the AB cell that gives rise to somatic tissues, while the posterior daughter forms the P1 cell that gives rise to both somatic and germline tissues. These different fates are a result of asymmetric segregation of proteins to the anterior and posterior sides of the P0 cell before division. In fact, at this stage in development, the embryo has no active transcription, but “survives” off of maternally-inherited mRNAs and proteins.\nAsymmetric protein distribution is orchestrated by the PAR polarity proteins. One of the affected proteins is MEX-5 which is phosphorylated by the posterior PAR protein PAR-1 (Griffin et al. 2011). Since PAR-1 is present only in the posterior half of the cell while the phosphatase PP2A is ubiquitous, the balance of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of MEX-5 differs along the anterior-posterior axis. Importantly, phosphorylated MEX-5 diffuses faster. As a result, slow-diffusing unphosphorylated MEX-5 accumulates in the anterior part of the cell. This gradient-formation mechanism was also recapitulated by a mathematical model (Griffin et al. 2011).\nThe MEX-5 protein binds to the 3’ untranslated region of various mRNAs, thereby activating their translation. One of its targets is zif-1, the mRNA encoding for the ZIF-1 protein, a E3 ubiquitin ligase required to degrade factors that promote germline fate. To perform its function, ZIF-1 protein needs to be enriched anteriorly in the future AB cell, and needs to be excluded posteriorly in the future P1 cell. ZIF-1 is also known to inhibit MEX-5 by binding to it, resulting in a negative feedback on its own translation activation.\nOne mechanism for the specific localization of ZIF-1 protein to the future AB cell is local zif-1 mRNA translation in the anterior half of the cell via the action of MEX-5. But what prevents the ZIF-1 protein from simply diffusing into the posterior half of the cell (the future P1 cell)? There are several possible mechanisms, for example:\n##Key References\nGriffin, Erik E., David J. Odde, and Geraldine Seydoux. “Regulation of the MEX-5 gradient by a spatially segregated kinase/phosphatase cycle.” Cell 146.6 (2011): 955-968.\n##Guiding Questions\nIn this project, you will implement a model to explore the above hypothetical mechanisms of ZIF-1 localization. Consider the following:\nDo the proposed mechanisms qualitatively result in spatially-localized ZIF-1?\nIf yes, how steep is the resulting ZIF-1 gradient?\n[Master-level] How robust is the result to parameter variation?\n[Master-level] Compare the mechanisms: Are they identical? Do they make different predictions (e.g. if a mutant is engineered, or the size of the cell is changed)?",

The organization of stem cell niches is generic such that stem cells produce progeny that divides actively in the transit-amplifying zone, and then differentiates. Notably, different tissues in have a different propensity of developing cancer, and it has been that this is due to“a combination of stem cell mutagenesis and extrinsic factors that enhance the proliferation of these cell populations, creates a “perfect storm” that ultimately determines organ cancer risk” (Zhu et al., 2016). Here you will explore with a multicelular model what is the relation of differences in SC activity and cancer risk.\nThey will receive a line of cells that duplicate with the same probability.
