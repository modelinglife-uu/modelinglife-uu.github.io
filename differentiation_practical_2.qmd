## Introduction 

In this practical you will study the effects of auxin, a plant hormone,
on gene regulation in the root. Auxin is a hormone virtually involved in
all developmental processes in plants, from embryo patterning and floral
organ determination to leaf disposition and root growth. In each
context, auxin triggers specific responses, which can be explained by
the underlying regulatory networks—namely by the redundancy of molecular
players in the auxin signalling pathway (the auxin response factors,
ARFs), and how they are expressed in different tissues.

In the root, researchers have found an auxin–WOX5 paradox: some
experiments show that auxin promotes the expression of WOX5 (a root
stem cell transcription factor), while others found WOX5 repression.
This opposite auxin regulation is mediated by different ARFs—ARF5 and
ARF10—posing the possibility that accounting for both ARF5 and ARF10
regulatory networks can reconcile the results. To this end, you will use
an in silico root model to address this paradox and propose an
explanation.

## Biological background 

Plant roots grow thanks to the presence of stem cells housed in a niche
at the root tip. A subset of these cells expresses WOX5, maintaining
the surrounding cells as stem cells. WOX5 is regulated by several
factors, and network models help us understand how.

The Boolean network used last week describes the gene and hormonal
activity configurations of the cells in the root apex. In this model
WOX5 is regulated positively by ARF5 and negatively by ARF10 and
CLE40. Auxin regulates stem cell activity in the roots, and multiple
links exist between auxin and the regulators in the Boolean network.
Both ARF5 and ARF10 are auxin response factors activated by auxin.
Moreover, root transcription factors control ARF5 and ARF10
expression such that they are not expressed in every cell of the root
apex. This regulation is included in the Boolean model we studied last
week. Whether this is relevant to understanding the auxin–WOX5 paradox
is unclear. Here, each cell of the in silico root model carries a copy
of the Boolean network, which allows us to test hypotheses and find an
explanation.

## The model 

The model simulates a root apex, showing the stem cell niche at the apex
(lime green cells in the cell graphics; purple cells in the WOX5
visualization). The different tissues of the root are spatially
organized. Each cell has a different set of expressed genes, which we
account for by initializing each cell’s Boolean network in the QC,
Vascular, Endodermis, and Columella attractors. (Cortex and epidermis
are not modeled.) Multiple grids store different cell properties:
cell-type, auxin levels, and expression of each gene.

You can visualize ARF10, ARF5, MGP, and WOX5 expression using
the provided plotting function.

## Files 

`Rootfunctions.py` – contains model functions. You do not need to
modify them but should understand what they do.

`Root-model-Auxin.py` – code to simulate the in silico root.

`auxin_grid.npy` – initial auxin levels in each cell.

## Questions 

:::{#exr-tur}

Algorithmic thinking

Familiarize yourself with the model. Examine Rootfunctions.py to see
how each process is modeled and how they are coupled.
:::

:::{#exr-tur}

Biology

What happens if you update the network every timestep? Does that make
biological sense? Where in the code can you make this modification?
:::

:::{#exr-tur}

Biology & algorithmic thinking

Simulate an auxin treatment by changing the AuxinTreatment parameter.
Try values of 10 and 750. This increases auxin levels in all cells by
the given amount.

How does auxin treatment affect gene expression in the root? (You can
visualize different genes by changing the grid provided to
plotGrids().)

Does the model output correspond to the transcriptional reporter of
WOX5 shown in Figure 1? Do you see activation or repression as
reported experimentally?
:::

:::{#exr-tur}

Biology & algorithmic/mathematical thinking

The model does not yet reproduce the experiments. To account for
quantitative effects of auxin, implement two hypotheses based on the
literature:

Auxin represses MGP expression.

Extremely high auxin levels (unrealistic in vivo) repress WOX5
expression.

Modify the equations for MGP and WOX5 in rootNetwork accordingly.

For MGP, retain its logical rule but multiply its production term by a
saturation function of auxin (Km = 45):

dMGP = (45/(45+auxininput))*((-np.exp(0.5 * h) + np.exp(-h * w_MGP)) / ((1 - np.exp(0.5 * h)) * (1 + np.exp(-h * (w_MGP - 0.5))))) - (lambda_ * MGP)

Similarly, add a negative regulation by auxin to the WOX5 equation
(Km = 1000).

Run control and auxin treatments with (i) updated MGP, (ii) updated
WOX5, and (iii) both updates.

Do you now see the differences reported by experimentalists?
:::

:::{#exr-tur}

Biological interpretation

You should observe that WOX5 expression gradually expands into the
endodermis and disappears from QC cells when both equations are updated.
This matches experimental microscopy. To explain repression:

Why do different parts of the root respond differently to auxin? Why
does induction occur mainly in upper cells and repression in basal
cells?
:::

:::{#exr-tur}

Algorithmic thinking

Experimental repression of WOX5 was detected by RT-PCR at the very
apex. Reproduce this in silico by saving the average WOX5 levels of
cells at the apex (y < 40) at the end of the simulation for all three
treatments. Plot them.

What is the root apex response to auxin treatments? Considering that
the root contains mixed cell types, which cells best represent your
plotted values?
:::

:::{#exr-tur}

Biology & algorithmic thinking

Repeat the analysis for all cells, for QC cells, and for endodermis
cells. Compare WOX5 regulation across tissues.

Do you see a difference between your observations and the simulated
RT-PCR plot? Why?
:::

:::{#exr-tur}

Biology & algorithmic thinking

Changes in WOX5 expression depend on tissue context and auxin dosage.
Simulate a range of auxin treatments from 0 to 750 (choose your step
size).

Can you now explain the auxin–WOX5 paradox? What mechanism do you
propose?
:::

:::{#exr-tur}

Biology & conceptual thinking

Perform an in silico intervention to alter WOX5 dosage
responsiveness. For example, enforce continuous induction or block its
induction in the endodermis. How would you test these model predictions
experimentally?
:::

:::{#exr-tur}

Biological thinking

All models are wrong, but some are useful. The model should offer
mechanistic insight into paradoxical auxin responses. Yet the original
experiments used different auxin analogs: NAA (transported
independently of PINs), IAA (PIN-transported), and NPA (blocks PINs,
increasing auxin in the apex). How does this information change your
conclusions? What extensions to the model would account for these
differences?
